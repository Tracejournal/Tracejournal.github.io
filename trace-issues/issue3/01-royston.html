<h2><strong>Between Page and Screen, Hands: What it Means to be an Embodied Reader</strong></h2>
<h3>Anne Royston</h3>
<h4>Rochester Institute of Technology</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: right;">(<em>Published September 16, 2019</em>)</h4>


<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
    In 2011, Chris Fritton of Buffalo-based Ferrum Wheel Press published a
    small-edition, handmade codex comprised almost entirely of
    letterpress-printed QR codes. The colophon, sole exception to the QR code rule, includes the author,
        press, and edition size but not the title, states that the book “is
        readable only by mobile phone apps.” Scanning the front cover reveals the title: <em>Why We Lose Our Hands</em>. (The tension between QR code and
    English-language title leads to some indexing confusion on WorldCat, as
    well as in some local libraries.) It’s a provocative title, and to reach it
    requires labor distributed among human and machine readers. Like “human”
    and “machine,” reading is another tricky word; as Mara Mills argues, it
    signifies a repetitive, often physical or haptic process, while also
    gesturing towards the more thorny, layered, nonprocedural, often
    uncomfortable sense (for example, what we really mean when we ask our
    students if they have read). The latter tends to be what we think of as a
    human-dominated idea of reading, working in tandem with a more machinic
    idea of “reading” (or what our students might mean when they assure us they
    have, indeed, read).
</p>
<p>
    Fritton’s piece stands at this intersection of multiple kinds of reading,
    themselves spanning digital and print (more shaky terms in this 2019 age of
    publishing and platform). The piece, when scanned, is recognizable, given
    its lineation, as poetry. In a clever medial inversion, hand letterpress
    printed QR codes are met with digital letterforms on a facsimile of the
    physical: the old Apple “Notes” application’s reverse remediation of a
    standard yellow notepad. The poem recalls the circumstances of its making
    and its reading, hand and hand-operated logics; the speaker refers to his
    “gauze-covered hands,” and to another person with “brown paper bags/ over
    his hands.” Using one’s hands—your hands, you implicated reader—is
    complicated, messy,
    and necessary to reading. And this is true regarding the phone as well as
    the codex, the former an example of a complex apparatus that at once
    enables reading and is itself a reader. As N. Katherine Hayles points out,
    differentiating “executable” from readable, “Once entered into the machine
    [code] has as its primary reader the machine itself” (<em>Mother</em> 50).
    Yet under the bright gaze of the screen, we often overlook the hands that
    access the camera and other manipulation required for machines to read; the
    eye scanning that leads to phone scanning; and the subtle cues, like
    lineation, that help the human reader make sense of the work. In the
    context of the mobile device there are two readers, but the distinction
    between the two is not easy or stable.
</p>
<p>
    Entangling different kinds of machine technologies—letterpress printing,
bookbinding, coding, handheld mobile devices—and ways of reading, <em>Why We Lose Our Hands</em> provokes an awareness of hands and,
    figuratively, the threads they bring together. At the same time these
    threads should be considered loosely held, performing their own kinds of
    work and affecting the complex dynamics of reading. In pieces like Amaranth
Borsuk and Brad Bouse’s <em>Between Page and Screen</em>, J.R. Carpenter’s <em>The Broadside of a Yarn</em>, and Emily Dyer Barker’s “Public Spectacle
    Essays,” hands are critical to the making, as well as consuming, of these
    works, which utilize QR or AR (augmented reality) codes in conjunction with
    print media.
</p>
<p>
    While QR codes create an additional wrinkle in our reading, their use works
    not to alienate the reader from the English-language text, but instead to
    demand a particular kind of attention. Reading print-digital works requires
    focus sustained across multiple platforms, where the QR code transforms
    each page into a mystery, and each translated code rewards the patient
    reader with curiosity satisfied. As noted at the Western New York Book Arts
    Center (WNYBAC), where Fritton produced <em>Why We Lose Our Hands</em>,
    what is known as a “Quick Response” code actually draws out the reading
    process. Paradoxically, the “Quick Response” forces the reader to slow
    down, as the page takes longer to read than it would in English-language
    text. The extended reading process also undercuts Fritton’s colophon’s
    claim that the work can be read “only” with a mobile phone app. The book
    requires the handling of a human, who positions and scans, and then reads:
    a deliberately physical experience that a quick flip through a
    conventionally printed codex often takes for granted.
</p>
<p>
    Such complex readable forms, combining text and code, characterize Hayles’s
    conception of what she terms the “Computational Universe,” which is
    “producing and also produced by recursive loops that entangle with one
    another” (<em>Mother</em> 4). This emphasis on recursivity, “producing and
    being produced,” recalls a genre of writing that also speaks to
    print-digital works: poetry. Discussing the “distributed existence” of a
    digital poem, Hayles comments that “the poem ceases to exist as a
    self-contained object and instead becomes a process” (“Time” 181). Hayles
    here is following poet and media studies scholar Loss Pequeño Glazier, who
    conceives of poetry as <em>poesis</em>, making. “Rather than focusing on
    the information of the text,” Glazier argues, “poetic practice has explored
    the conditions that determine information, the procedures, processes, and
    crossed paths of meaning making, meaning-making as constituting the
    ‘meaning’” (32). Among genres, this thinking goes, poetry is singularly
    equipped to explore the kinds of variable communication new media
    technology enables.
</p>
<p>
    Glazier’s poetic genealogy includes Emily Dickinson, Robert Creeley, and
    Ron Silliman, as well as other Objectivist and Language-affiliated poets—a
    group that might take William Carlos Williams’s “No ideas but in things” as
    a philosophy. This genealogy constructs itself, loosely speaking, around a
    sense of the word as material. Glazier extends materially oriented poetics
to contemporary e-poetry, asking: “Thinking of Creeley’s
    ‘form is never more than an extension of content,’ what avenues of content
    have been opened by such vastly different possibilities for ‘form’?” He
    adds that “The medium gives the poem added potential for ‘making’” (34).
    The “medium” of new media is particularly apt for the making that is the
    essence of <em>poesis</em>.
</p>
<p>
    But of course, print-digital works are not equivalent or reducible to a
    category of digital literature. In fact, to our eyes they may appear much
    like artist’s books, which, in Johanna Drucker’s well-known formulation,
    “integrate the formal means of [their] realization and production with
[their] thematic or aesthetic issues” (<em>Century</em> 1). At the
    same time, Drucker—herself a hybrid maker-theorist working with analog and
    digital inscriptions—constantly reminds the reader that all reading
practices, even digital ones, are grounded in material. In    <em>What Is?</em>, among other writings, Drucker takes aim at the myth that
    “digital code is immaterial, permanent, and stable” (126). Besides the nod
    to arguments by, for example, Matt Kirschenbaum, Drucker notes what she
    calls the “first error, the failure to engage with materiality as
    embodiment” (ibid). Print-digital works, whether as codices, broadsides, or
    webpages, possess the self-reflexive material forms that fulfill Drucker’s
    definition, but they also incorporate the labor-intensive old media
    practices that often characterize artists’ books. Fritton and Barker’s
    projects are both letterpress-printed by hand, and Borsuk and Bouse’s book
    was originally also letterpressed before entering production as two
    small-press editions, first by Siglio Press and then by SpringGun. This
    first edition was also hand-bound, as is Fritton’s codex, while Carpenter’s
    maps are folded by hand. Print-digital works implicate the haptic in their
    procedures of making, an emphasis on being handled that carries over to the
    processes of reading.
</p>
<p>
    The always-material word also suggests a larger argument about the
    intersection of print and digital, gesturing at how the two fields of
    contemporary artists’ books and digital literature share multiple
    affinities and similar discourse. These fields pride themselves on
    interdisciplinarity and flexibility, yet still hesitate around work that
    combines elements from both. But these works are already speaking to one
    another, demonstrating how the idea that language is always material
    benefits from considering the tenuousness of “old” and “new” media
    definitions (as seen in work by Charles R. Acland or Lisa Gitelman, for
    example). Using old media techniques like letterpress in combination with
    new media techniques like QR codes, print-digital works remind us how old
    and new are themselves shifting spaces, palimpsests of meaning that define
    and redefine one another. The complex multiplicity of materiality recalls
    “intermedia,” a term originating with Dick Higgins that Hayles and other
    digital theorists repurpose. Higgins, a noted book artist of the Fluxus
    school, argues for the importance of intermedia, a hybrid approach to genre
and media, in his 1969 classic <em>FOEW&amp;OMBWHNW</em>, itself a
    multicolumnar collage of essay, poetry, and experiment. Originally reserved
    for genres and media amongst themselves, Hayles expands “intermediation” to
include “this entanglement of the bodies of texts and digital subjects” (<em>Mother</em> 7). Entanglement suggests an irreducible situation: as
    Drucker refuses the idea of material print and immaterial code, Hayles
    refuses the either-or of human and digital, and insists that “media
    effects, to have meaning and significance, must be located within an
    embodied human world” (ibid). If QR codes seem to suggest alienation, ways
    to lose our hands, these works counter that supposition by actively
    requiring our hands and our handling—and they dramatize that need for
    embodiment through their material form.
</p>
<p>
    There are many ways to approach this “embodied human world,” most which
    highlight the multisensory nature of experience. As scholars like Andrew
    Piper and Cecilia Lindhé point out, touch becomes especially crucial to the
    digital environment, with transformative possibilities for how we read.
    Lindhé cites Mark Paterson: “By exploring tactical and auditive aspects in
    relation to ancient rhetoric and digital interfaces, one can also begin to
    ask with Paterson ‘whether it is possible to go beyond the ocular centric
    in traditional aesthetic and literary practices, and consider other modes
    of experience and forms of attention, such as those made available by
    touch’” (Paterson 2007 quoted in Lindhé). Shifting attention from the
    visual to the tactile or haptic “rejects discourses that try to transcend
    the body,” as well as provides new perspectives from which to consider how
    we read, especially in an age of what feel like newly immersive medial
    experiences (Lindhé).
</p>
<p>
    In print-digital works, however, touch transcends even this purpose.
    Print-digital works, however, stress touch that furthers immersion not for
    its own sake but premised on curiosity, on desire. These are profoundly
    human stakes for digital communication technologies, and we glean a sense
    of them through considering the semantic content—lyrical, collaged,
    crowdsourced—of print-digital works. While their material forms require a
    multisensory and embodied reader, their semantic content sheds light on
    what it means to <em>be</em> that reader. Being an embodied reader is not
    simply a question of mechanics, not just a question of how we use our
    hands, but why. Being embodied is being emotional, affective,
    psychological, wanting to hear and be heard. It is not only recognizing how
    the boundaries of the body—its senses like touch—create our experiences,
    but also recognizing how we rush towards those boundaries, driven towards
    the world.
</p>
<p>
    Echoing the “you” addressed by Fritton’s narrator, a “you” that is the
    created poem but also the traditional lyrical object of desire,
    print-digital works concern themselves with connection, community, and
    collaboration as subjects. They rely on community participation in a manner
    reminiscent of Serge Bouchardon’s writings on intersubjective digital
    media, but at the same time present what is often explicitly emotional
    content, expressing a longing for successful communication. Hands become
    the figure for manipulating pages and cameras, but they are also the figure
    for reaching out, touching, linking: the digits in the digital. How, these
    works ask, does contemporary technology convey desired information, promote
    understanding? Instead of positioning current technology as rampantly
    antagonistic to human concerns, as some contemporary discourses do (a title
    below, <em>War on the Human</em>, conveys this kind of defensiveness); or,
    conversely, embracing the neutral and transparent tools of technological
    utopianism; print-digital works set up camp between these two extremes.
    Exploring the interplay between page and screen, these works stress the
    need for human touch through their material forms, while their semantic
    content suggests an analogical desire to understand and be understood.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Exchanging Letters</strong>
</p>
<p>
A multilayered love story, Amaranth Borsuk and Brad Bouse’s <em>Between Page and Screen</em> develops a haptic-executable, digital-human
    network of reading. Like Fritton’s <em>Hands</em>, <em>Between</em> is a
    print book comprised entirely of AR codes, accessible with the help of a
    web browser running Flash and a camera. A website specific to the book
    reveals the English-language text, which hovers, as the title indicates,
    between the print page and the digital screen.
</p>
<p>
    As with other print-digital works, <em>Between</em> identifies as poetry.
    Closely following Glazier’s concept of <em>poesis</em> in her reading of the
    work, Tatiani G. Rapatzikou locates its poetics in process, which extends
    from the work’s “interpretative potential” to the “readers’ practical
    engagement with it” (101). Rapatzikou argues that the “prosthesis” of the
    AR code reader reconfigures conventional reading practices at a physical
    level, which raises the possibility of reconfiguring “human cognitive
    abilities and perceptual capacities” in general (109). Through its
    overlapping codes and interpretive processes, which belong to both human
    and machine reader, <em>Between</em> thus exemplifies the possibilities of
fundamentally new ways of reading. Élika Ortega also speaks to <em>Between</em>’s medial complexity, citing a Haylesian entanglement of
old and new media and their varied readers. Ortega’s incisive reading of <em>Between</em> notes “the bringing together of different media and/or
    interfaces that guide specific reading conditions, and which cannot be
    broken down into its individual components without crippling the textual
configuration of the work.” At the same time, Rapatzikou focuses on <em>Between</em>’s “different configurations and ways of seeing and
    understanding the creative potential of poetic and digital joined actions,”
    while not giving much consideration to how its medial concerns are enacted
    through its semantic content (112). Ortega, likewise, argues that “the main
    aesthetic as well as theoretical exploration of the project lies in the
    layered reading experience much more so than in the verbal poems
    themselves.” A reading of the poems “themselves,” however, reveals the
    stakes for the multimodal reading experience, implicating a fully embodied
    reader in the process.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps part of why it’s tempting to fly over the English-language poems,
    when you finally have them at your fingertips, is that they, as
    letterforms, are themselves prone to fly. Unlike <em>Hands</em>’s online
    component,maintaining a stable screen of text in <em>Between</em>
    is nearly impossible. The reader becomes acutely aware of their hands as
    they struggle to manipulate each page into a position from which the text
    can be read. If the reader moves too quickly, the letterforms escape from
    view; as the reader approaches the best angle for reading, the letterforms
    fall away. The body of these letterforms is ghostly, suggesting the
    transience of communication, a tenuous connection apt to disintegrate at
    any moment. Like audio signals vying with static, the letterforms hover,
    barely achieving dimension in space.
</p>
<p>
    Many pages are letters—not letterform, but epistolary form, missives
    exchanged between P[age] and S[creen]. Between pages of letters, pages of
    moving poems refuse to stabilize even when the reader is still, instead
    rearranging in positions and transpositions. Recalling Drucker’s maxim on
    artists’ books, their semantic content is self-referential: the
    Oulipean-like anagrams of “to spin pin into spin” and “she hears shears
    ear” point to their own functions and processes, as well as those of the
    reader, who “hears” as the word “shears.” Moving and “spinning” in time and
    space, the poems create a kind of n-dimensional concrete poetry: “a
    rose/eros” even directly recalls Augusto de Campos’s visual rendering of
the famous Gertrude Stein quote, “A rose is a rose is a rose.” “Eros” also returns us to the epistolary letters that link P and
    S. As in Fritton’s work, the “you” signifies the poem’s creation, but also
    the lyric “you,” the object of desire whom the speaker addresses.
    Similarly, Borsuk and Bouse’s work takes a dual subject, not only the
    potential within an intermedial poetics as process and product, but the
    story (intimate bordering on sensual) that spans screen and page.
    Attempting communication, the page and the screen are cast as characters.
    They are letters as well as actors in an unfolding drama of desire.
</p>
<p>
    Like the poetic lineage Glazier invokes, the poem exhibits a post-Language
    style through sound-driven language that, despite its tendency towards
    parataxis, feels alive—and feels. “Dear S,” the poem begins, “I fast, I
    fasten to become compact, but listen, that’s only part your impact…It’s my
    character to pin” (<em>Between</em>). Imploring the addressee to “listen,”
    P attempts to make itself understood. There is mention of “last night on
    the patio,” and an invitation to “spread out the pentup moment.” In this
    charged atmosphere, the page reaches out to the screen, even as it fails to
    achieve the “compact” data a screen may call up. Unlike the screen’s
    flickering connections, the page, a print medium, admits an impetus to
    “pin” or fix its “characters” in place. In contrast, the screen’s responses
    tend towards the fluid, the spinning letters and rearranging words of the
    dimensional concrete poems, although not exclusively. “You only get a
    portion of the stuff that makes me up,” S writes. “The rest hides,”
    presumably in the circuit boards and copper materials of the computer. But
    S’s somewhat lofty tone also hides something, P supposes: an emotional
    component. As the exchange progresses, the reader comes across an etymology
    for what’s happening: “Scaramouch, scrimmage, skirmish,” and, associated,
    “screen.” This etymology is shaped like a shield, something which protects,
    but which can also be hidden behind. The dialogue is cast as a skirmish,
    which itself is cast as a “screen” for feeling.
</p>
<p>
    Many moments in <em>Between</em> explore this bivalent meaning of screen,
    as that which hides or keeps something from view, and, simultaneously, the
    apparatus or “prosthetic” that helps make the poem visible to its human
    reader. Borsuk notes: “A screen is a shield, but also a veil—it’s sheer and
    can be shorn.” If “skirmish” is related to shield, it is also related to
    its natural counterpart, the sword that “shears.” As the two characters
    attempt to understand one another, they reveal facets of their own
    characters, their attempts at negotiating self-definition reminiscent of
    our attempts to define communication that mingles old and new media. The
    screen is self-protecting, but it points to this fact, suggesting a desire
    to be seen and heard. The page, meanwhile, is anxious to stabilize
    meanings. “Let’s name this pagan pageant, these rows of lines or vines that
    link us together,” P urges near the poem’s end, to which S replies: “Page,
    don’t cage me.” If “that way is carnage, carnal carnival” linked to the
    embodiment of the page, the page’s ability to cut (“paper cuts”) and do
    harm also frightens the screen. The page’s closeness to, even dependence
    on, the fingers, suggest an inevitably human (and intimately physical)
    affiliation.
</p>
<p>
    The skirmish ends coyly, but favorably: the last page reads, “P.S. A
    co-script posthaste postface:/ there is no postscript. Sleep tight,” with
    additional Ps and Ss scattered in disarray that also might suggest the
    “post” of postcoital. P and S, it appears, have “co-scripted” this ending,
    which captures the doubleness of script as writing and as code. “Postface”
    reads as a statement that “facing off” has ended, which is also the end of
    the book as the dialogue comes to a close. Of course, the dialogue itself
    functions as a kind of <em>en face</em> translation between media,
    Higgins’s intermedia exploded into Haylesian intermediation. “Postscript”
    also speaks doubly here, indicating the written addendum as well as
    PostScript, a (somewhat outdated) page description language in computing.
    Regardless of medium, the poem suggests, “there is no postscript,” no way
    in which language is over. On the contrary, it increases and proliferates
    beyond expectation, driven by the constantly renewing need to hear and be
    heard.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Between</em>
    makes the reader a party to the proliferation of language, which requires
    the AR code reader to be readable. At the same time, the human hand becomes
    an agent that passes letters between P and S—indeed, it is nearly
    impossible to avoid the visual intrusion of hands on-screen as the reader
    manipulates the text. Our status as messenger is complicated by our status
    as third party to the conversation, which requires us to operate even as it
    excludes us to the position of voyeur. From <em>voir,</em> “to see”, voyeur
    solidifies the link between hands and eyes: as Lindhé’s title states,
    taking a cue from F.T. Marinetti, “A visual sense is born in the
    fingertips.” <em>Between</em> suggests that so, too, is a sense of enabling
    communication, an impulse to facilitate understanding. As the work unfolds
    and recombines, the story between P and S expresses the desire to be
    understood, even loved, that drives its multifold technologies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Navigating the Self</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Jason Farman remarks that the goal of much site-specific storytelling, or
    locative narrative, “is to ‘defamiliarize’ people with their places and the
    technologies that mediate these places” (5). According to Farman, “the
    result is often a deeper sense of place and a stronger understanding of our
    own position within that place” (ibid). But what if our positions are
constantly shifting—or if the place is constantly changing?J.R. Carpenter’s <em>The Broadside of a Yarn</em> contemplates these as mutually informative
    questions, deeply linking place to personhood and positing instability not
    as a stop on the way to full self-awareness but as a state of being in
    itself. If the drama in <em>Between</em> plays out around understanding the
    beloved, <em>Broadside</em> seeks something even closer to home and possibly
    more elusive: to understand oneself.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Broadside</em>’s print component comprises 500 A3-sized copies of manipulated and
    collaged maps, each folded by hand and originally installed, as well as
    distributed, in the Inspace gallery, Edinburgh, Scotland in November 2012
    (“Broadside”). Incorporated into the designs, although decidedly not the
    centerpiece of them, are QR codes, which lead to a dizzying array of
    sources, all related to the sea and navigation (suggesting the broadside as
    print product, but also as ship), as well as the passage between Scotland
    and Nova Scotia (where Carpenter was born). Additionally, the digital
    materials have been manipulated and collaged. Carpenter refers to the
    project as an “assemblage” that combines print media, digital tactics, and
    human activity. Here, new and old media successfully combine to
    “de-familiarize” the reader’s relationship to place, but their effect, far
    from stabilizing, instead reminds her of these terms’ fragility.
</p>
<p>
    As the reader navigates her place in space, she also navigates different
    conceptions of space, each produced by print or digital aspects of the
    work. <em>Broadside</em>’s two-dimensional print maps recall the
    representation of Cartesian space that feels outmoded to many of us, while
    the QR code places its reader in a type of space—cyberspace—in which a new
    kind of representation is developing. QR codes figure digital space, as
    they literally serve as a map to a URL (the reassuringly named Uniform
    Resource Locator). But successfully navigating from print to digital space
    is not the only end of the work. As Carpenter explains, “Embedded within
    the highly visual cartographic space of this printed map are QR codes which
    link mobile devices to computer-generated narrative dialogues intended to
    serve as scripts for poly-vocal performances” (“Broadside”). These
    performances, implicating the voice as well as the hand, mark far points of
    the network of reading, an immersive reading experience that leads the
    reader back to the body. What begins with the hand ends with the voice.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Broadside</em>
    thoroughly entangles human and digital, ephemeral movements and
    performances, and stable maps and webpages. Navigating this entanglement of
    media—reading— is not at all a sure thing. How to handle maps from which
    north has been excised, from which other elements have been cut away? QR
    codes, readable from any cardinal direction, provide no assistance. Lines
    on the print maps suggest coastlines, casting the two voices that dominate
    the text as voices of sea and shore. But even navigating (a word which
    calls to mind an old browser) the print-digital coastline rarely reveals a
    stable object. Sea and shore, print and screen, are all fluid, with code
    and human readers often encountering new content with every navigation.
    While the print maps are almost entirely image-based, the QR codes deliver
their readers to carefully assembled suites of texts. <em>Broadside</em>’s “selected bibliography” mentions Scottish archival materials such
    as maps and 17<sup>th</sup>-century guidebooks, as well as literary
    investigations of navigation: Edward Lear’s poem “The Owl and the
    Pussycat,” Shakespeare’s <em>The Tempest</em>, and Joseph Conrad’s short
    story “The Secret Sharer” (in tandem with Freud’s writings on the uncanny).
    Adding another layer of remediation, many of these literary investigations
    form the basis for works by Carpenter that simultaneously exist as
    stand-alone pieces: “Notes on the Voyage of Owl and Girl,” “There he was,
    gone,” and “…and by islands I mean paragraphs”are self-sufficient works of
    digital literature from around the same time, while “Once Upon A Tide” was
    published elsewhere a few years later (<em>Luckysoap</em>). Each of these
    pieces has its own bibliography as well. Remediation here takes the form of
    collage, with sections extracted, grafted, and arranged in what feels like
a gently pulsating, constantly expanding whole. As a project, then, <em>Broadside</em> also functions as a map, through which the reader may
    navigate a selection of Carpenter’s cartographically obsessed oeuvre.
</p>
<p>
    Further complicating <em>Broadside</em>, some of Carpenter’s stand-alone
    works offer different experiences on web and mobile. “There he was, gone,”
    for example, is a visually complex digital literature piece on a web
    browser, with different text lines moving at different speeds across a
    photograph on a map background. Scanned with the QR code reader, the
    stripped-down work takes the form of a text block, in which some chunks of
    text slowly change while others remain stable. Handheld, the mobile version
    also gestures to the voice, emphasizing the stage direction at the top that
    indicates: “To be read by two voices.”
</p>
<p>
    Some pieces to which <em>Broadside</em> points are unstable, remediating
    themselves from platform to platform or with every reading. Other pieces of
    the project shelter more neatly under its auspices—or at least that’s what
    their URLs, including “broadside” as a term, suggest. <em>Broadside</em>
    -specific pieces also tend to have greater navigational control for their
    users. “Trading Lip For Ear,” which remediates and reassembles Conrad’s
    “The Secret Sharer” and Freud’s idea of the uncanny, is a robust example of
    a <em>Broadside­</em>-specific piece that dramatizes, as its title
    suggests, speaking and listening. In it, Carpenter becomes a kind of
    carpenter, building a script from pieces of text like the timber beams of
    the boat in the corresponding print map. Here, as throughout the piece,
    doubling is a critical concept. It occurs at both medial and semantic
    levels: J. (R.) C(arpenter) and J. C(onrad) trade voices like winds,
    Carpenter animating Conrad’s characters by resetting them in a dialogic
    form. Similar to “There he was, gone,” instructions like “To be read by two
    hushed voices, heads together” preface the body text, which comprises a few
    lines of dialogue traded between the Captain and the Sharer. The Captain’s
    last lines include “asides,” which traditionally offer a glimpse into the
    mind of a character, much as the associated print map shows a cutaway hull
    that reveals the inside of a ship. As the dialogue between the Captain and
    the ghostly Sharer repeats, taking on new variations, the reader’s mobile
    screen offers a set of navigational tools: “Fast,” “Slow,” “Stop,” “Step,”
    and “Uncanny,” which incorporates Freud as a third voice. The first two
    commands operate as promised, moving you through the text at different
    speeds; “Stop” allows you to linger on a piece of text, while “Step” moves
    you forward. The Freud channel, though, introduces another voice into the
    text that, instead of clarifying the connection between the two speakers,
    further complicates the distinction between inside and outside. If the
    uncanny is linked to the phantasmal for Freud, it is also linked to
    repetition: “Anything that reminds us of the inner compulsion to repeat is
    perceived as uncanny,” one text node reads. To repeat is to double, even if
    inexact, an obsession for both J. C.s.
</p>
<p>
    Remediation allows the internal and external to entangle in this work,
    which is mirrored again by the two speaking parts. The reality of the
    relationship between the Captain and the Sharer, both here and in the
    original, is deliberately ambiguous, suggesting one body and two minds. If
    Conrad doubles as Carpenter, this doubling is also modeled in the text, in
    which the Captain doubles as the Sharer. The Captain meditates, for
    example, “It was as though I had been faced by my own reflection in the
    depths of a somber and immense mirror” (Conrad 9). Or, again: “My double
    followed my movements” (Conrad 10). Freud provides an appropriate gloss:
    “The self my be duplicated, divided and interchanged” (<em>sic</em>).
    Carpenter’s transcription error feels suggestive here, pointing to an
    instability of identity: who is the me of the “my”? Dialogue becomes an
    attempt at navigation, locating oneself in a relationship to another, even
    if this other is another part of oneself, met again—or for the first time.
</p>
<p>
    “Trading Lip For Ear’s” frequent emphasis on doubling invites the reader to
    enter, too, her hand on the compass. Even with all these navigational tools
    at hand—maps, instructions, and QR code readers—she will, however, not
    quite succeed at locating herself. Carpenter notes how situating one’s past
    and present is also a spatial quandary, a present and past that links “New
    Scotland” and “Old Scotland,” and which continues to shift despite the
    proliferation of mapping (and storytelling) accoutrements. But it’s crucial
    to remember that the navigational tools are only part of the work. In fact,
    Carpenter directly states that the broadsides “are representations of the
    work, not the work itself” (“Broadside”). In a project problematizing
    location, locating the “work itself” is no less of a problem. The best
    option may well be to abandon navigation altogether in favor of a different
script. “Like the printed broadside ballads of old, the public posting of <em>The Broadside of a Yarn</em> signified that it was intended to be
    performed,” Carpenter reminds us of the original installation
    (“Broadside”). From this perspective, the project suggests a different kind
    of navigation, one where the reader envisions their own role as one of many
    in a performance, enabled by the dialogic nature of the text.
</p>
<p>
    Like Bouchardon’s new media as intersubjective object, collectively
    determined, <em>Broadside</em> muses that attempting to reach beyond one’s
    personal perspective, rather than self-interrogation, may be a more
    reliable way to come to understanding. As the Captain seeks to know himself
    through his Sharer double, <em>Broadside</em>’s dialogic form emphasizes
    the performance that links together multiple readers. The performance
    itself is sometimes actual—at least one full performance has taken
    place—and always potential—Carpenter notes the project remains “ongoing”
    (Broadside”). (This potential-actual pole also mirrors the Captain-Sharer
    dynamic that toggles between real and unreal.) Crossing space and time,
    such a performance might link a reader to another reader even without their
    awareness.Discussing the influence of locative media applications on
    cognitive mapping of a place, Didem Ozkul and David Gauntlett point out
    that
</p>
<p>
    Within this process of representation and creating a self-narrative of
    one’s everyday life through location information, a tool commonly used for
    identifying routes—the map—comes to be used as an interface, where users
    can create their own geotagged stories of their lives. (113)
</p>
<p>
    In this view, locative media enable ever more robust mapping. Carpenter’s
    piece mines the tension between the potential of locative technology, the
    paper maps of the installation complicated by the QR code’s tantalizing
promise of “more information online” </a> for the reader, and the
problem of knowing or understanding one’s location in a fluid system. <em>Broadside</em> is critical of the fixedness any kind of map, old or new
    technology, promises. At the same time though, it looks past the map,
    emphasizing the abilities of and possibilities for the embodied reader in a
    performative space. A map, after all, is a kind of script: it must be
    executed by its reader, achieving its purpose at the moment it’s left
    behind. With its collage of text, image, and script, <em>Broadside</em>
    creates what Lindhé terms a “space-body-word-image-nexus,” which provides
    the premise for performativity. Touch and voice both exceed the boundaries
    of self in the search for others, which doubles the search for
    self-understanding.

<p>
    <strong>Reading Networks, Reader Communities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As artworks or artists’ books, print-digital works rehearse the history of
    the QR code, usually with a critical eye. The QR code was first developed
    in 1994 by Denso Wave, at the time a subsidiary of Toyota, for tracking
    vehicles and parts in manufacturing (“History”). Its main domain, as any
    consumer will recognize, is corporate marketing: through a (usually free)
    app on the consumer’s phone, scanned QR codes invite their user to explore
    more about a product online. For Fritton, Carpenter, and Borsuk and Bouse,
    using an advertising tool in the service of art feels subtly political, a
    comment on the book as possessing its own kind of value. Yet the QR code’s
    roots in advertising are not so different from the origins of the
    broadside, which was originally a large printed announcement, argument, or
    advertisement prominent in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. In contrast to these
    historical ephemera, the contemporary broadside is, while still
    letterpress-printed, more likely to bear a poem printed by a fine or
    university press, intended to be framed and displayed.
</p>
<p>
    Drawing on aspects of both the prosaic, mass-produced advertisement and the
    poetic object, Emily Dyer Barker’s intermedial broadside series is possibly
    the most collaborative and distributed of our print-digital works.
    Collectively titled the “Public Spectacle Essays” as noted on her
    Kickstarter, the series spans three related projects: “How To Write A Crazy
    Love Letter” (February 2012), “Acceptable Reasons To Cry In Public”
    (November 2012), and “I Miss Everything About You” (July 2015). Through
    their conceptualization, process, distribution, and documentation, these
    essays explore the affordances of old and new media and the kinds of
    communities these media enable. Like Fritton’s work, Barker’s broadsides
    explore the tension inherent in letterpress-printing a QR code intended to
    be read by machines, its executable component directly dependent on hand
    printing. Here, the sense of poetics as process and the concept of poetry
    as media directly overlay each other, as the process of making comments on
    the objects made. Further complicating the reading network is the notion of
    the series itself. “How To Write A Crazy Love Letter” contains six
    broadsides, each with its own title, and a seventh broadside produced as a
    colophon. Each broadside, in addition to its title, QR code, and
    accompanying text, notes its number in the series, drawing the reader not
    only along the axis from printed text to digital text but from one printed
    text to the next. “Acceptable Reasons To Cry In Public” and “I Miss
    Everything About You” each contain four individual broadsides, likewise
    marked. Unlike a bound codex, however, the possibility of reading an entire
    series is entirely dependent on how the reader encounters the work. These
    are ergodic and radically locative pieces, located in disparate
    environments that require non-trivial labor—and some luck—to traverse.
</p>
<p>
    The series’ production values read as an homage to broadside culture.
    Printed with a combination of wood type (“over 100 years old”) for the
    title, handset metal type (“also very old”), and photopolymer plates
    (“brand new”) for the QR codes, Barker views these media as historically as
    well as aesthetically located (“Crazy”). The sheer number of broadsides
    printed also declares these as a kind of ephemeral object, or at least, one
    to be used in a manner consistent with advertising broadsides of old,
    despite their letterpressed content: the edition for the first series
    totals an astounding 2,473 broadsides, with the second and third editions
    set at a slightly more modest 350 per broadside (for a total of 1,400 per
    series). As the edition size indicates, the broadsides are intended to be
    executed, like a code or a script, as a public installation.
</p>
<p>
    As in <em>Broadside</em>, where the object doubly functions as itself and
    as part of a larger performative work distributed in space and time, the
    “Public Spectacle Essays” deem themselves “multi-city letterpress poster
    installations” (“Cry In Public”). After the first series, Barker enlisted
    Kickstarter backers as “curators” who would receive a set of broadsides for
    a nominal fee with the instructions to install them and document the
    result. In the second series, the collaborative potential is even greater:
    as part of the process, Barker crowdsourced and curated the text for the
    broadsides (“Cry In Public”). The project relies on varying degrees of
    participation, including a robustly active version in which reader becomes
    co-author. Though multiple avenues, Barker’s project attempts to implicate
    the widest possible public. Brought online by prior involvement, word of
    mouth, or by the QR code, readers become community members with myriad
    roles, creating a project with increasing global span. Meanwhile,
    documentation steadily amasses online, where readers submit pictures of
    where they see the broadsides using created hashtags. Each series itself
    has designated Twitter or Instagram feeds, which often include additional
    text that extends the scope of the project even further.
</p>
<p>
    The “Public Spectacle Essays” utilize a wide range of media, but they
    maintain a deliberateness about that usage. Despite the robust web
    presence, Barker does not provide PDFs of the broadsides themselves,
    insisting on the tangibility of the physical object and its almost
    Benjaminian link to its haptic origin. She remarks, “The exhibition
    examines the contrast of extravagance with ephemera—taking something made
    by hand (at physical cost) and posting it in a public place where it is
    vulnerable and temporary” (“Miss”). “Extravagance” is conveyed in the
    work’s design by its range of colors (including metallics), while the
    websites also offer different remediations: once scanned, the QR codes
    reveal a typewritten text; additional texts online are designated by also
    being typewritten and scanned. As an intermedial project, then, the
    “Essays” create a complex logic. The broadsides generate digital responses,
    which are then remediated into analog (typewritten) texts, before being
    transferred back online. The process of transfer is a scan: not
    coincidentally, the same action of a mobile phone required to read the
    original broadsides. The work continually touches its haptic origins at the
    same time it spreads through digital methods. The first project’s colophon
    is even handwritten in pencil on yellow notebook paper (not the iOS
    notebook, but the wood pulp kind) and scanned to the project’s website, a
    prominent display of work by hand and a reminder of how language is
    embodied both in media and in oneself. As is the case when using pencils,
    erased sections of text hover as ghosts, emphasizing the incompleteness of
    any remediation.
</p>
<p>
    While the “Public Spectacle Essays” intermingle old and new media to
    communicate their content, their content also considers communication:
    where it succeeds, where it breaks down. Barker’s self-effacing titles
    playfully display their preoccupation with emotional state as “spectacle,”
    whether it be crying in public, composing a message of ardor, or lingering
    on a melancholy past. Taken as a whole, the broadsides explore the
    turbulence of emotional states with humor and empathy, emphasized by their
    use of second and first person. The broadside titles under “How To Write A
    Crazy Love Letter,” for example, include “You must be able to face
    crippling regret” and “The situation must already be out of hand.” Body
    text for “Acceptable Reasons To Cry In Public” describes how emotions are
    sparked by trivial and traumatic occasions. One broadside ends, “You can’t
    get the gas pump to work. You saw an old man at the grocery store buy one
    can of cat food, a pint of milk, and a candy bar. You are somewhere besides
    the apartment you share with your estranged husband.” When scanned, the
    online text (again, typewritten) provides a simple gloss, a pause amongst
    the litany of emotions the broadsides profess; rather than an overarching
    thesis statement, the online component simply adds further nuance to the
    piece. This subtly shifts the attention from finding any real conclusion to
    the pleasures of reading across media that suggests different
    subjectivities and perspectives. The tactile-readerly pleasure is further
    complicated as the reader becomes implicated in the spectacle. Reading
    multiplies into a haptic performance, born of the work’s material form and
    the psychological performance of empathy.
</p>
<p>
    The emotions prompted by the “Public Spectacle Essays” are deliberately
    physical inscriptions in space, often public space. In fact, the project
    was born when Barker saw, spray-painted on the side of an expressway, the
    five words that would become the title of the final series: “I Miss
    Everything About You.” Barker notes, “In a society with almost unlimited
    electronic means of publication, the five hand-written words were a witness
    for the power of language to create a physical site of connection”
    (“Miss”). Hence the “spectacle” of the essays, which suggest that it is
    possible for “complete strangers [to be] pulled into another person's
    intimate grief—just by sharing the public space” (“Cry In Public”). As for
    all the print-digital works under consideration here, material form is in
    service of larger questions about how we understand one another. Public
    space, shared space, becomes the ground for the sharing of emotion.
</p>
<p>
    Individual answers to these questions are incorporated into the project as
    well: Barker requests and encourages documentation of encounters. One
    Kickstarter backer relates, “My daughter and I pulled on our coats and
    posted them around town in the fading afternoon light. It was a strangely
    moving experience” (“Cry In Public”). For these readers/curators, the
experience becomes inseparable from the work, extending Glazier’s <em>poesis</em> to a radically ongoing process in which work is placed in
    the hands of readers who distribute it in varying spaces, at varying times.
    In one case, two readers who come across the broadsides digitally follow
    the QR code to reveal GPS coordinates, which they then physically follow to
    the original site of the graffiti (“Crazy”). The graffiti has been removed,
    but a QR code is present, plastered on the side of a concrete barrier.
    These readers then create a video essay about the experience and post it
    online, engendering even further reaction. In this moment it is impossible
    to separate the various texts from the experience of them, which the
    documentation provides in a remediated form. The embodied nature of that
    experience, however, holds as much weight—possibly more so—than any medial
    representation of it.
</p>
<p>
    Physical and digital space, linked by human agents, constantly remediate
    each other in Barker’s project and all print-digital works. Occupying a
    unique position between the electronic and the artist’s book, print-digital
    works implicate an extensive network of reading, a Haylesian feedback loop
    that involves both machine and human. Seeking to know others and oneself,
    these works turn to surprising and compelling combinations of old and new
    media, destabilizing the definitions in the process. But destabilization is
    not their end goal. Rather, their entangled composition argues for a more
    thorough consideration of the embodied reader: far from losing our hands,
    they become indispensable as we manipulate a print map, a mobile phone, a
    website, or the pages of a codex. While tactility and other sensory
    explorations create an immersive experience for the reader, these works are
    interested, too, in more than just immersion. They insist on touch, a sense
    which, in Paterson’s formulation, “is a sense of communication. It is
    expressive, receptive, can communicate empathy” (1). These ideas are
    mirrored in the semantic content of print-digital works, which are
    preoccupied with the emotional and psychological aspects of communication.
    Their subjects—lyrical, dialogic, epistolary, performative—reflect their
    human concerns.
