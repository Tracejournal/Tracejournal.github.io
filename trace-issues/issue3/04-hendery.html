<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
    Behind the “hackathon” process lies the idea of the adoption of our natural
    sense of play for a more serious purpose. For many—if not most—participants
    in hackathons who work or study in technology-adjacent fields, a hackathon
    asks them, ostensibly, to spend approximately 12-24 hours (over one or two
    days) rushing to complete an urgent project. Often, this involves doing the
    same tasks they would be doing in their daily work, such as prototyping,
    programming, or building hardware, but with longer hours and a more
    intensive pace. Why then would people choose to participate? Alongside its
    pragmatic values—networking, gaining skills, contributing to projects with
    an avowedly social purpose, and a certain fraternity of technology
    enthusiasts—we argue the liminal nature of this work/play space also
    attracts and binds its adherents.
</p>
<p>
    “Playbour” (Fuchs; Gregg), or the disguising of work as play, has
    occasioned critical attention in technology-intensive contexts of gaming,
    start-up cultures, and extracurricular coding events. Often entwining
    languages of sociality and commercialism, hackathons frequently make
    explicit their blurring of these boundaries. Where Google provides free
    food, a bowling alley, massages, and yoga classes in the hope that its
    employees might never want to go home, hackathons compete for their
    participants’ weekend time and attention with sponsored food and drinks,
    pool tables for breaks, the prospect of friendly competition, and new-found
    ‘friends’ sitting around on bean bags brainstorming crazy ideas that an
    employer might never greenlight. The playful elements of the event
    differentiate it sufficiently from work, while the work-like elements
    provide a structure and a sense of purpose to the time: a sequence of
    mini-goals throughout the weekend that make participants feel their
    ‘investment’ of time is worthwhile. As environments for hacking practices,
    hackathons foreground oscillations between serious and ludic activity,
    generating a continual inter<em>play</em>, force, or tension.
</p>
<p>
    With this notion of play as a key motif, in this paper we explore the
    tensions and opportunities associated with making hackathons: the ephemeral
    events and products, the playbour activities, the persistent organisations,
    physical spaces, people, and structures that provide infrastructure for
    them, and the virtual layer associated with these real-world elements as
    they pertain to hackathon events in Western Sydney, Australia. The
    structure of our paper is divided into five sections: introduction,
    literature review, case study, discussion, and conclusion. This
    introduction has proposed the playful contradictions that hackathon events
    offer: the boundaries between physical and imagined communities, play and
    work, amateur and professional, as well as reality and virtuality, become
    blurred. Our literature review discusses recent critiques of hackathons,
    and attempts to plot a more redemptive orientation through an emphasis on
    their civic uses, which we further unfold through concepts of play-struggle
    and in-betweenness. The third section is a case study of our collective
    experiences as organizers of hackathon events, as owners of social
    enterprises, and as citizens of a city that is embracing the
    experimentalism of these forms of making unevenly. Our observations reflect
    on the difficult work and engaging play involved in generating new maker
    communities—spanning local, global, and imaginary scales. We then discuss
    how places, intermediaries, and publics can be imaginatively augmented via
    a process of prototyping through play. We close by suggesting that these
    processes combine in a “play-struggle” (Söderberg) that characterizes and
    complicates the hackathon process, which unsettles, in addition to
    play/work binaries, other distinctions between physical and imagined
    communities, amateur and professional practices, as well as real and
    virtual experiences.
</p>
<p><strong>Literature Review: Hacking, Play-Struggles, and In-Betweenness</strong></p>
<p>
    Critics have charged hackathons and similar events with a kind of default
    and uncritical complicity with regimes of neoliberalism: literal
    playgrounds for the cashed-up kids and corporations of the digital economy
    to appear to give back to society without continued responsibility for its
    effects—or lack thereof (e.g. Irani; Olma; Cardullo, et al. for variations
    on this theme). Alternatively, by encouraging free labour that remains
    subject to the oversight conditions of a competitive environment, for many
    young participants such events risk “normalising the solitude and
    insecurity of perpetual debut” (Gregg, 196). Without ignoring these
    provocations, we argue the recurring conduct of socially-oriented
    technology sprints do in fact produce other institutional and communitarian
    effects.
</p>
<p>
    Hackathons, we argue, can be oriented toward the broader benefits of “civic
    tech,” or even “speculative civics” (DiSalvo, et al., 4980), in contrast to
    the characterization of hackathons as sites for the production of more
    individualized and profit-motivated ‘entrepreneurial citizenship’ (Irani,
    813). As Robinson and Johnson describe, hackathons include a range of
    types, for example “entrepreneurial app contests,” which serve to
    “produc[e] a ready-to-use mobile device app,” and “civic hackathons,” which
    centre “more on sharing, animating and generating feedback on civic open
    data sets” (71). Our focus is on a kind of hackathon that is more closely
    aligned to such civic goals, where places, intermediaries, and publics are
    motivated by an intent toward social openness and political possibilities.
    Under this conception, hackathons would serve to further a form of
    “speculative civics,” as “a way to explore potential, alternative, and
    future conditions by articulating their existence in generative forms, with
    a particular focus on the complications of governance and politics disposed
    by computational technologies” (DiSalvo, et al., 4980).
</p>
<p>
    Such speculative and exploratory work also points toward the ambivalent
    nature of the term “hacking” itself. In <em>Hacking Capitalism: The Free and Open Source Movement</em>, Söderberg
    associates hacking with German poet and philosopher Friedrich Schiller’s
    concept of the “play-drive”: “the only force that could heal the
    fragmentation in society and in the human being” (161). Noting how
    “hacking” oscillates connotatively between prior concepts of play and
    labour, Söderberg goes on to introduce the notion of the “play struggle,”
    explaining how “playful doing, simply from being an end in itself, is
    destabilising to a system built on the principle that everything and
    everyone is a means for something else” (183). In the context of
    goal-driven hackathons, “systems” can refer to the organisational context
    of the event as much as the wider system of the political economy that
    Söderberg intends: in both cases, play disrupts as well as makes possible
    the aims of work.
</p>
<p>
    If the outputs of hackathons sit in a state of limbo between initial idea
    and completed project, the events themselves also sit within an “in-between
    space”: between play and work, between amateur and professional, and
    between the real and the virtual. This blending of work and play conditions
    a potentially destabilising affective experience of categorial liminality
    or what Giesen has termed “inbetweenness.” Playful engagement with
    technology has become a naturalized process that lies at the heart of
    “maker” culture. By tinkering, breaking, remaking, and repurposing
    technology, we learn the fundamentals of what makes it work. Even just by
    using tools in ways that they were not necessarily intended, we experience
    the extent of their capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    Motivated by exploring the role of play in how we make, we have sought to
    pay attention to the wider forms of “inbetweenness” of hackathons that
    exceed linear limits of time and bounded notions of space. The intensive
    nature of hackathons—typically operating anywhere between half a day to a
    week—have, as Irani (800) and others have noted, served to produce specific
    kinds of making outputs, processes, and experiences. Their appeal, along
    with much of the critique that has followed their initial uncritical
    endorsement, stems precisely from this sustained intensity, which contrasts
    with the sub-day temporal format of meetings, classes, seminars, and
    workshops, and with the longer time frames usually expected of projects,
    semesters, and organisational lifetimes.
</p>
<p>
    A further kind of inbetweenness is found in the spaces between events, and
    within those events, among the actors involved. If the hackathon events are
    points in time, the lines that connect these points are organisations,
    physical places, people, and structures, persisting as a semi-stable
    platform that contextualizes and facilitates them. Further, in terminology
    adopted from neuroscience via social network theory, if the hackathons are
    nodes in a network and these organisations, people, and places are the
    connecting edges, we must also pay attention to the generation of what
    Mejias terms “paranodality” (606), which refers to the spaces outside of
    what the network captures, but that also reside in between its nodes and
    edges. In this case, we would suggest, the network space encompasses the
    real-world elements of the hackathons and their surrounding infrastructure,
    while the paranodality includes the virtual: the augmentation of reality
    that technology inevitably constructs. Hackathons, we argue, are in-between
    spaces which evade capture and control, and which operationalise forms of
    play-struggle. These events have key features that may be replicated, but
    never fully reined in, as our case study illustrates.
</p>
<p><strong>Case Study: HACK Western Sydney</strong></p>
<p>
    Our account covers the running of four weekend hackathon events over a
    two-year period, between late 2015 and late 2017. HACK Western Sydney<sup>1</sup> is a global organisation that runs biannual hackathons for
    social enterprises, community organisations, and individuals. Since 2011,
    HACK Western Sydney has been highly active in Australia, with well-attended
    events in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, and with increasing exposure in
    smaller urban centres such as Ipswich and Bendigo. The authors, comprising
    researchers and practitioners, have organised the Western Sydney regional
    offshoot since December 2015. The overall HACK organisation and its
    satellite, node operations—across a range of cities and countries—is based
    on abiding by the main principles of the network: open-source projects that
    are aimed at social change.
</p>
<p>
    In a (playful) nod to Bratton’s formidable account of sociotechnical
    arrangements presented in <em>The Stack</em>, we narrativize our account
    not chronologically, but through a similarly layered structure: the <em>Sketch</em> (a critical non-coding part of hacking); the <em>Event</em>
    (of the hackathon); the <em>Organisation</em> (hosting the event), and the <em>City</em> in which the hackathon and organisation are based. Our
    observations draw from meetings with prospective change-makers, committee
    meetings, lead-up events, and the conduct of the hackathons themselves; one
    of us was involved in founding and maintaining the organisation and all of
    us are involved in the city of Parramatta and its start-up scene through
    our shared experiences of life as citizens, workers, consumers, and active
    participants in other local organisations and start-ups.
</p>
<p><em>Sketch</em></p>
<p>
    The canonical image of the hackathon is one of programmers huddled over
    screens, frenetically coding. While this may occupy much of the time of the
    hackathon event, in our view the activity of <em>sketching</em>, on paper,
    napkins, whiteboards, or in computer-based tools, is the playful
    communicative core around which processes of social hacking—coding,
    researching, writing, designing, developing ideas—take place. The sketch as
    an ad-hoc, quick, and messy way to jot down ideas, which can then be shared
    and modified, socializes the digital process of <em>how we make</em>.
</p>
<p>
    We can also describe how, in the context of hackathons, the sketch
    functions as the inscription of a mutable or hackable idea, which can be
    added to, amended, crossed out, copied, versioned, reinterpreted,
    implemented, or tested. In inviting feedback, criticism, and collaboration,
    it is a generative artefact driven and produced in an intensive period over
    food, drinks, and discussion over a meal or coffee, around a table, or via
    digital communication. It might then be discarded and forgotten, or refined
    and leveraged.
</p>
<p>
    Sketching connotes creative and collaborative dimensions lost in popular
    inflections of “hacking.” It literalizes the sometimes-obscure technical
    terms of “architecture,” “design,” “prototype,” and “open source,” and as a
    shared activity, it communicates the semantically austere vocabulary of
    digital disciplines across divides of expertise. At each of the hackathon
    events, sketching has been the liminal experience that brings together and
    blurs processes of play and work. The pursuit of the “beautiful” sketch can
    be as intimidating and alienating as the exhibition of technical prowess,
    an exercise that engenders and emphasizes relations of power as much as
    more technical activities. To draw people in, to encourage open dialogue
    and participation, we have learnt to pay careful attention to the spatial
    arrangement of chairs and tables, to the provision of a multitude of
    sketchable surfaces and pliable instruments, and to cultivating a healthy
    disregard to aesthetic value. At the beginning and throughout the weekend
    event, we encouraged collaborative sketching as a way of physically
    realising the “open source” ethos of the hackathon event.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, sketching produces a range of different group dynamics. Just
    as sketching ideas on a napkin in a café depends upon the expertise and
    playful contributions of others, our experience of the hackathon sketching
    suggests it is similarly opportunistically driven, adjusting to and
    depending upon the range of expertise and openness to play in the group.
    Moreover, there are frequently differences between the sometimes-ambitious
    scope of sketches—particularly in the case of wireframes or ambitious
    software architecture—and their eventual materialization at the end of the
    event. One of our challenges, as we discuss further below, has been the
    recruitment of experienced developers. This has meant that hackathon teams
    often produce attractive ideas sketched on paper that cannot be realised in
    practice. For example, if a project was to be an Android app, but no one at
    the hackathon has experience developing for that platform, the idea either
    has to be abandoned or reconceived. An idea might have to be scaled down if
    fewer people are available to work on it than expected. Or two projects
    that share similarities might need to be combined with a single, new focus
    if there are only enough skilled participants in the room to develop one or
    the other.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, and partly through our own organisational design, the temporal
    and participatory constraints of the hackathon event also limit the
    parameters of play or experimentation through the sketching process.
    Augmentation of the imagination always exceeds the limits that are not only
    temporal (over a hackathon period), but participatory as well (based on who
    is assembled in the room and online for that time). While HACK Western
    Sydney is, on the one hand, deeply embedded in a particular place and time,
    digital projects, on the other hand, are not (at least explicitly) so
    constrained. As such they are often deployed in or aimed at a very
    different community than the one in which they are born.
</p>
<p>
    This produces well-documented biases of gender and race in technology
    artefacts (Zou and Schiebinger; Hankerson, et al.) and suggests significant
    structural and artificial constraints on the scope of play generally.
    Blamed for the failure of many products from Silicon Valley, software
    development methods frequently fail to take into account the needs of those
    excluded from the design process, or included only through the limited
    frame of reference of “user testing.”
</p>
<p>
    In the case of HACK Western Sydney, community members involved in
    development are less likely to be wealthy, white, or from English-speaking
    backgrounds, but they still may be developing technological “solutions” for
    problems with which they have little direct experience. Recent such
    examples from HACK Western Sydney projects include a crowdfunding platform
    for homeless people, or a wayfinding application for inhabitants of
    Bangladeshi slums. Even a project that is not aimed at users from such a
    narrowly-defined demographic is still likely to be used by people whose
    needs and expectations the developers cannot easily anticipate, and the
    format of a single-weekend development event does not lend itself to user
    testing or market research. This decoupling of physical, real space and
    virtual, technology-deployment space thus creates another experience of
    liminality or disjunction. The very limits of play (both temporal and
    participatory) always coalesce with freedom and experimentation, with
    possibilities for both affirmative or deleterious effects.
</p>
<p><em>Event</em></p>
<p>
    As the example of sketching shows, the parameters of a hackathon’s
    orchestration sets the parameters for whether and how play takes place, and
    its tenuous affective and substantive relationship to work. As an event, it <em>intermediates</em> work and play. In the case of HACK Western Sydney,
    we were encouraged to start the event in Western Sydney after several of us
    attended a similar event in Sydney’s Central Business District (CBD). The
    Sydney event was well-populated with social change champions and
    prospective hackers, and the project we were collaborating on was grounded
    in Western Sydney, aimed at residents of a low socioeconomic suburb. After
    the event, we discussed how it would be a good opportunity to replicate a
    similar event in Western Sydney. This had several motives: to establish a
    hackathon that was more accessible to residents who are potential
    beneficiaries of the hackathon; to understand how hackathon models adapt in
    different locations; and to examine more closely what new forms of
    capacity-building and community arise.
</p>
<p>
    In the earliest iterations of the HACK Western Sydney events, we followed
    the hackathon model set forward by the international HACK organisation.
    This consisted of a series of clearly defined and structured lead-up events
    (information evening, ideation night) followed by a weekend that was
    characterised by pitching a project, refining a “minimal viable product,”
    and working in separate, competitive groups to complete these by the final
    afternoon, when they were to be judged by an external panel. The
    organisation also promotes use of various staples of the technology
    industry, such as Agile programming, communication via Slack, and
    depositing of the projects on GitHub.
</p>
<p>
    Over time, we decided to steer the HACK Western Sydney events to better
    reflect the needs and expectations of the local community. Without a large
    pool of advanced developers already familiar with programming culture,
    reliance on Agile methods, Slack (a team messaging tool), and GitHub (a
    software repository) imposes an additional learning curve. The distances
    that many in Western Sydney have to travel to attend impose a further
    burden that has been alleviated by combining the multiple pre-hackathon
    evenings into a single event. As a response to this, and to the desires of
    many who have participated, after the first event we removed its
    competitive element. The HACK events have never been as competitive as some
    other hackathons, as there are no large prizes up for grabs, no secrecy
    about the project plans, and no prohibition about building on earlier work
    or beginning before the actual weekend. We also found that the
    pre-hackathon “ideation” night helped to avoid too great a sense of
    competitiveness, as the projects’ champions “pitch” their ideas, receive
    feedback from all present, and form small brainstorming groups that often
    were not, in our events, composed of the same people who would work on that
    project on the hackathon weekend itself.
</p>
<p>
    Over time the competitive element of HACK Western Sydney has decreased even
    further, as we noticed that the boundaries between “teams” became blurred.
    More experienced developers moved between projects to assist multiple
    groups, and people with specialized skillsets created shared assets like
    databases or artwork that could be used by all of the teams. As the
    organising committee, we explicitly encouraged this collegial approach.
    After the first event, we also abandoned the invitation of external critics
    to “judge” the projects, and eventually transitioned the “judging” session
    to something more oriented towards show-and-tell and peer review. We
    noticed this format produced a distinctly more relaxed atmosphere, and have
    continued to stick with it.
</p>
<p>
    At the most recent event in June 2017, we experimented with the more
    deliberate inclusion of some programming training for those attendees who
    wished to improve their coding skills. Several one-to-two-hour structured
    learning sessions were run during the Saturday using the Processing
    programming language to generate images and animations. Participants were
    gradually stepped through interactive exercises to a point where they could
    generate procedural artwork for use as logos in the various hackathon
    projects. Though we did not design the session for this purpose, these
    exercises and their outputs performed precisely the kind of sketching we
    discuss above, producing sample designs and logos that other teams were
    able to use in their projects. We intend to continue with the integration
    of code clinics into future events, another in-betweening of consumption
    and production that departs from the performative conventions of the
    hackathon model, but one entirely consistent with the needs and interests
    of the Western Sydney maker community.
</p>
<p><em>Organisation</em></p>
<p>
    We ran all but the first of the hackathons at the offices of The Incubator<sup>2</sup>, a Parramatta-based social enterprise that provides
    community-oriented software development and co-working facilities. Since
    its inception in 2012 it has developed open-source digital platforms,
    community-oriented events, and start-up programs for social enterprises. It
    contributes actively to the local urban social enterprise scene,
    contributing to and hosting a range of meet-up and hackathon events. As an
    organisation with day-to-day operating expenses and challenges, it has been
    able to participate in the enthusiasm that often attends individual
    hackathon events, while also witnessing how these events may contribute to
    the longer-term development of urban ecologies.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to hosting the event, as a local organisation, The Incubator
    provides a crucial further intermediating platform that supports, socially
    and technically, the hackathon’s outputs. It is a place where: research can
    be undertaken and shared, together with lived experience, prior to the
    event taking place, to inform development; people can develop their
    innovation and technology toolkit through meetups and code clubs throughout
    the year; the models and prototypes developed at a hackathon can continue
    to be developed into a minimum viable product to attract real investment;
    and existing organisations can collaborate, or a new organisation can be
    formed, to deliver the real potential of the project.
</p>
<p>
    The Incubator was created following the co-founder’s participation in
    government “think-tanks” and “community consultations” at Federal and Local
    Government levels, and attendance at “hackathons” in 2009-2010<sup>2</sup>. The Federal government’s “Government 2.0 taskforce” and
    Local government’s “eParramatta” initiatives in 2009-2010 resulted in two
    quite different outcomes. The Government 2.0 taskforce spawned “GovHack,” (<a href="https://www.govhack.org/">https://www.govhack.org/</a>) which is
    now the world’s largest open government hackathon. In contrast, the
    “eParramatta” initiative led to the formation of government committees and
    working groups that had little community participation or visible tangible
    outcome.
</p>
<p>
    At this time the Australian chapter of the Social Innovation eXchange,
    AuSIX, was formed, and their inaugural Australian social innovation camp
    was held as a hackathon by another name. Over the course of that weekend,
    the two winning entries developed prototype websites to welcome refugees
    and connect them into local communities on the one hand, and empower
    volunteers with micro-volunteering opportunities on the other. These are
    two themes that commonly arise at Australian hackathons to this day.
</p>
<p>
    Influenced by the famous distinction between the “cathedral” and “bazaar”
    models of software development (Raymond), and frustrated by their
    experience in the “cathedrals” of traditional law firms, the co-founder
    resolved to create a space that could provide a “bazaar” for social
    innovation in Parramatta. The enterprise developed to address the slow
    progress in influencing public policy through traditional means, using the
    direct action and activism of the “social hacker movement” emerging from
    free and open-source software (FOSS) circles. The Incubator also provided a
    technology platform and team that can help accelerate the development of
    innovation both over the course of a hackathon weekend, and subsequently
    into a minimum viable product. The platform was developed in response to
    the common recurring themes at hackathons relating to volunteering,
    fundraising, communications, and matching wants and needs.
</p>
<p>
    While hackathons generally apply an open-source or creative-commons
    licensing model to the works created during the event, The Incubator is
    focused on developing broader models of “sustainable sharing.” The FOSS
    model prioritises the rights of the user, over the rights of the maker.
    However, this model creates a burden for the makers that may only be
    sustainable in an ecosystem comprised of co-creating users who contribute
    to the initial production, or to improvements that make the project
    continually better for everyone, and not in a situation where the majority
    of users are demanding, non-contributing members. Situations of the latter
    nature have resulted in burn-out and projects being abandoned.
</p>
<p>
    Having initially attempted to attract funding for the continued development
    of projects under a FOSS model, The Incubator has found that not all social
    innovation projects have Raymond’s “Necessary Preconditions for the Bazaar
    Style.” In fact, both government- and private-sector support can be more
    forthcoming when a project is focused on delivering value and a return on
    investment, which may preclude a FOSS model (at least initially). Through
    its ongoing activities The Incubator is facilitating the development of an
    intertemporal community, connecting participants of the different forms of
    hackfest and innovation project with interested users, practitioners,
    academics, students, private and public agencies, and investors.
</p>
<p>
    As a neutral space, independent of any particular institution, The
    Incubator enables people to get away from “everything” at their traditional
    workplace or home, to focus on making “the thing” that their project is
    committed to developing. Due to The Incubator’s focus on social innovation,
    it is developing a community of cross-disciplinary expertise to assist
    makers in developing their projects, and is proactive in connecting makers
    where synergies may exist between projects in order to create shared value.
    It is a social bazaar that seeks to enable sustainable sharing, and
    alongside events like hackathons, functions as a critical intermediary
    between practices of playful sketching and wider aims of generating
    proto-publics.
</p>
<p><em>City</em></p>
<p>
    Parramatta is a fast-growing urban satellite region 25 kilometres to the
    west of Sydney’s CBD, itself the centre of the large geographic area of
    Western Sydney, comprising low-density residential suburbs, industrial and
    agricultural zones, and natural parks. Long known as a “dormitory suburb,”
    supplying a workforce to Sydney’s commercial centre, the recent long
    housing market boom has created a new commercial and creative optimism in
    Parramatta that has witnessed strong growth in advanced manufacturing
    businesses, experimental maker start-ups, and community-oriented social
    enterprises.
</p>
<p>
    As residents and workers in Parramatta, we also experience the city as a
    literal geography of place-making. A beneficiary of Sydney’s enduring
    property boom, over the two-year timeframe of our analysis it has witnessed
    an explosion of new high-rise residential and commercial buildings, much of
    which serves to accommodate Western Sydney’s growing population. Consistent
    with contemporary global urban rhetorics of smart city development, space
    activation, and entrepreneurial citizenship, the local council has
    encouraged, in its discourses and policies, start-ups, social enterprises,
    and civic-oriented events and festivals.
</p>
<p>
    This environment has produced a number of Parramatta-based organisations
    keen to kick-start or refine their digital and commercial strategies
    through hackathons such as those run by HACK Western Sydney. However, and
    despite the presence of several large consulting firms in Parramatta
    (Deloitte, KPMG, Price Waterhouse), the city has not yet developed the kind
    of thriving technology sector that so readily populates hackathon events
    in, for instance, the city of Sydney itself. Like much of Western Sydney
    (though less so than urban centres farther South East, such as Fairfield
    and Liverpool) its population is disproportionately made up of recent
    migrants, who focus on finding accommodation, work, and education.
</p>
<p>
    We suspect these and other factors have led to the Western Sydney
    hackathons being attended by much smaller numbers of participants,
    typically 15-20 people, with a range of skills that extend from coding to
    management, business development, design, and copyediting. While the events
    have lacked the technology concentration of comparable events in
    Australia’s major urban centres, they also generated a high degree of
    connectivity between participants in HACK Western Sydney and other related
    events in Parramatta, including other hackathons, festivals, sustainability
    networks, and local business, political, and university events. The
    insularity of technology practitioners, a feature often complained about at
    other events, has been largely absent as a consequence.
</p>
<p>
    As a wider site for urban making, these positive aspects need to be
    calibrated against Parramatta’s challenges. Compared with Sydney’s central
    suburbs, the small business sector is dominated by personal service
    industries, such as hospitality, accounting, and hair stylists. Moreover,
    and despite council policies and investments, urban development
    overwhelmingly centres upon hard, rather than soft, infrastructure. From
    the extension of the major freeway bordering the city’s south side, to the
    array of generic skyscrapers recently completed or under construction,
    Parramatta appears to us at times to be integrating few of the
    prescriptions for sustainable development, equitable housing, or tactical
    urbanism espoused by much recent critical urban scholarship. In the face of
    seemingly unfettered highly financialized construction, our organisational
    group wonders: can hackathons and social enterprises function as more than
    cosmetic adornments, or are they signs of a process of gentrification that
    do little to remediate its more destructive effects?
</p>
<p>
    As we have discussed with respect to the hackathon events and the social
    enterprise, such affective despondency is more often countermanded by
    specific interactions and relations that evolve in the course of their
    conduct. At the level of experience of the city itself, it has made us more
    attuned to other cases and places of play and experimentation, and our
    conversations with others involved in community practice and technology
    innovation betrays a similar appreciation. Irrespective of the scale and
    size of impact, our sense is of numerous potentialities forming precisely
    through similar cooperatives and initiatives.
</p>
<p><strong>Discussion: Prototyping through Play</strong></p>
<p>
    Drawing from the literature review and case-study, our discussion outlines
    the ephemeral aspects of hackathons, what we term <em>prototyping through play</em>. The quick and playful event of sketching
    images and notes onto a napkin is motivated largely via critical
    making—participating in the process of collaboration and experimentation to
    produce a shared, open-source prototype for social change. This knowingly
    imperfect prototype as a public good is in contrast to the desire to make a
    perfected product, for simply utilitarian or individualistic ends (such as
    slick products, competition, or rewards). Hackathons provide a particular
    time and space where participants can share, explore, and imagine ideas and
    speculative models for the future. The partial and temporary hackathon
    process is imbued by “material <em>participation”</em> (Lodato and DiSalvo
    “Hackathons as Material Production” 539ff) rather than simply production.
    The coalescing constraints and freedoms which hackathons offer, we suggest,
    produces a collaborative and liminal space. This liminality unfolds from
    the “inbetweenness” afforded via <em>playful places</em>, <em>socio-technical intermediaries</em>, and the making of <em>protopublics</em>, each of which are described in further detail below.
</p>
<p><em>Playful places</em></p>
<p>
    This aspect illustrates the ways in which the phenomenon of
    play—simultaneously grounded within and beyond a place, as well as
    activated via particular rituals and rules—emerged from the hackathon
    process. Larsen’s focus on place and spatiality provides a nuanced
    interpretation of the phenomenon of play, describing it as “a spatial dyad
    consisting of two different layers of spatiality. The first is concerned
    with actual reality or locality of play, while the other is interested in
    the spatiality of a mental augmentation” (187). The augmentation afforded
    through play and place shows the nexus between artefacts and the
    imagination. But how is this spatial dyad of play activated?
</p>
<p>
    In exploring play as cultural phenomenon, Huizinga highlights the following
    key features of play: it is voluntary and transitional, characterized by
    limits of time and space, as well as a “play-community” (12), which creates
    both order and tensions. Combining Larsen and Huizinga’s insights helps us
    to highlight the ways in which hackathons attract participants as “playful
    places,” which are divergent in terms of fostering freedom and exploration,
    while also converging particular places, times, and rules. These divergent
    and convergent aspects merge to produce interstitial spaces encouraging
    participants to play with failure, experimentation, and risk. Rather than
    emphasising the product, or output, of a hackathon, the notion of playful
    places points to the ad-hoc, ongoing spatial and temporal tension of
    hackathons: the present and localized creation of a sample artefact, or
    prototype, entwined with a future intent. Observing hackathons as always
    improvising with available resources and opportunities, Lodato and DiSalvo
    describe how “ad hoc design” is “characterized by adjustments to the scope
    and outcome of a prototype <em>during making</em>” (6).
</p>
<p>
    The process of this ad-hoc making via play—comprised of the finitude of
    place and resources, as well as the freedom and fleetingness of
    augmentation raised above—can have a range of repercussions. Aligned with
    the ethos of speculative civics mentioned earlier, the term “critical
    making” (Ratto) helps to draw our focus upon “the act of shared
    construction itself as an activity and a site for enhancing and extending
    conceptual understandings of critical sociotechnical issues” (254). The
    degree to which these hybridized, playful places are oriented toward
    individualized competitiveness and entrepreneurship, or <em>critical</em>
    making and sustainable sharing, is influenced largely by the
    socio-technical intermediaries involved.
</p>
<p><em>Socio-technical intermediaries</em></p>
<p>
    This aspect illustrates the ways in which we experience the hackathons as
    enacted through new arrangements of people and platforms. The
    socio-technical intermediary describes, for example, the organisations,
    events, and networks that can connect different forms of expertise to
    inspire engagement not only during the short-term hackathon event, but
    sometimes with a longer-term view as well. In the context of cities and
    socio-technical transitions, Hodson and Marvin describe intermediary
    organisations as new forms of urban governance, “which are set-up to
    intervene in a variety of ways in existing systems of producing and
    consuming resources” (482). They highlight how the focus and temporality of
    these intermediary organisations differ according to focus (project-focused
    or systemic), and time-scale (months to years), depending on priorities and
    motivations. In light of advances in digital governance and the role of
    software technologies, Williamson describes how a new range of “innovation
    intermediaries” have popped up: “from a loose hybrid of the think tank, the
    social enterprise and the charitable organisation, merged with aspects of
    the digital R&amp;D lab (all of which are themselves contested, elastic and
    emergent organisational forms)” (299). Technological advances have blurred
    the boundaries of these urban and digital forms of governance, from which
    new socio-technical intermediaries arise.
</p>
<p>
    A diverse range of such intermediaries have sprung up as hackathons have
    become more common. These events have become popular across non-profit,
    industry, government, and educational organisations. Two trends shaping
    hackathons, as Lodato and DiSalvo describe, include their increasing
    purposiveness, “organized around a social topic or context, such as
    environmental well-being, food systems, or citizenship, rather than being
    organized around a technical platform” (Lodato and DiSalvo, “Hackathons as
    Ad-hoc Design Events,” 1) and their professionalization of hackathons,
    evident from large prizes, corporate sponsorship, and even venture capital
    offerings. The first trend opens up opportunities for participants from a
    range of backgrounds and organisations to contribute and “hack” a problem
    or issue, a shift from the initially software-focused events with primarily
    programmers attending. The second trend has added financial incentives,
    awards, and public prestige to participating in the event, adding a
    markedly different motivational gloss. The points of differentiation across
    these socio-technical intermediaries is threefold, spanning: their
    motivations (profit, or non-for-profit); incentives offered (financial
    prizes, social networks); and maintenance (the degree of infrastructure and
    support beyond intensive hackathon events). For instance, an open-source,
    sustainable sharing model means participants have fewer constraints on
    leveraging what they have done.
</p>
<p>
    These varying tendencies signal how socio-technical intermediaries can
    organise hackathons with different tendencies and modes of participation:
    between making and <em>critical</em> making. The former gears events more
    toward individualized competition and rewards, whereas the latter is
    energized largely by collective critique and care. Next, we outline an
    aspect which emerges from the socio-technical intermediaries and playful
    places outlined above: the generation of publics-in-the-making oriented
    more toward collective benefits, rather than individualized
    entrepreneurship.
</p>
<p><em>Protopublics</em></p>
<p>
    This third aspect outlines the unfinished objects, or prototypes, which
    were developed via the hackathon process&mdash;as well as the shared learning
    and communities which emerged. Together, these digital objects (such as
    apps or websites) and collective expertise (designers, programmers,
    community members) instigated new possibilities, or publics, to form. While
    the products and publics are not final, the value is not in any slick
    finalisation, but rather in the very shared process of formation. The
    instantiation of these new publics speaks to a liminal, or transitional,
    state that has been momentarily inscribed and can have both planned and
    unplanned effects. The term “protopublics” has been used in the context of
    undergraduate writing classes showing how the sharing and embedding of
    ideas in writing is always a process of making public, or publishing
    (Eberly). Eberly describes the process of students “thinking, talking, and
    writing about and for different publics” as instigating the very process of
    forming new and “overlapping publics” (172). These written outputs may not
    be mainstreamed or communicated to large audiences, yet it does not limit
    the expression and potential for these ideas to inspire and connect both
    intended and unintended audiences. The notion of protopublics has also been
    explored in relation to hackathons (Lodato and DiSalvo, “Hackathons as
    Ad-hoc Design Events,”; “Material Production”); as the authors emphasise,
    material participation is both key to these events, and often insufficient
    for the realization of their wider civic goals. “Just as the various
    artefacts and systems construed through issue-oriented hackathons are
    suggestive and incomplete of the means needed to address the issues, so too
    are the publics that are constituted through these events” (554).
</p>
<p>
    It is useful to apply this notion of protopublics to what emerged from the
    process of hackathons, how the ad-hoc process of participants thinking,
    talking, and making enables potential publics to form. While these publics
    may not be fully realized, they offer samples and possibilities, rather
    than finalized products. As raised earlier, play and intermediaries can
    have varying motivations, which can inform the types of publics in the
    making. In accordance with the notion of “speculative civics” (DiSalvo, et
    al., “Hackathons as Material Production”), the intent is not simply focused
    upon a product to be realised beyond the prototype stage, but is more about
    how projects can be “activities and artefacts of design to explore future
    civic conditions and consequences” (4987). Hackathons, we propose, offer an
    in-between space from which playful places and socio-technical
    intermediaries can foster protopublics.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: Continuing the Play-Struggle</strong></p>
<p>
    The drive of play blurs the boundaries between physical and imagined
    communities, play and work, amateur and professional, as well as the real
    and virtual. Hackathons and their varying expectations, incentives,
    participants, and rewards mutate the event and process in different ways.
    This means that the process of play is neither arbitrary nor impartial, or
    as Söderberg explains, “[p]lay is by default organized in communities and
    these bodies constitute the cells of play struggle” (174). This speaks to
    the “play struggle” and the interplay between place, socio-technical
    intermediaries, and publics we highlighted in our findings.
</p>
<p>
    We began this paper by considering the question of what incentivizes people
    to give up their time to participate in a hackathon and solve a challenge,
    one that may or may not result in a finished product. The focus on the
    process, rather than the end product, aligns with a playful drive: the
    freedom beyond necessity. It is this very playfulness which we need to
    return to, the messy and collagic aspects of <em>how</em> we make, rather
    than the veneer of neatness and completeness of <em>what</em> we make.
    Alongside the glowing success stories of familiar and common-place
    technology—websites, tools, and products such as Google search, the Amazon
    shopping portal, or Apple computers—exists a lesser-known or shadow world
    of ephemeral digital fragments. Neither household names nor widely parodied
    failures, these are projects begun but left unfinished. Or finished but
    lacking users. Hosted, but not linked to. At the bottom of page nine of the
    search engine results for their keywords. Nested within the “long tail” of
    uncited and unfollowed source code repositories. This is a not-unusual
    outcome of digital projects and tools created through hackathons,
    incubators, and even short-term academic projects. The incomplete and
    temporally fleeting nature of these projects is often problematised, but in
    this paper we aim to have highlighted some of the more positive aspects of
    the production of technological ephemera.
</p>
<p>
    Hackathons, social enterprises, innovation and co-working spaces, and
    living labs belong to a new vocabulary of organisational terms that
    occasion enthusiasm, scepticism, and increasingly within academic
    discourse, critique through their championing of techno-solutionism and
    their sidelining of questions of labour, sustainability, and corporate
    responsibility. Against these responses, we have argued the analysis of
    hackathon events over time shows other functional behaviour. Specifically,
    the temporal purview of hackathons particularly can operate as
    organisational and communitarian fillip against the more well-established
    durations of intra-day (the meeting, the event, the seminar, or even the
    work shift) or multi-week (the project, the semester) processes.
</p>
<p>
    The merits or otherwise of the duration of hackathons has not been our
    central focus here. Rather, one of our aims has been to explore the
    specific relationship of this quite tactical scale of time to other, longer
    timeframes involved in less tangible but more strategic processes of
    “platforming,” community building, and the evolving of technological and
    social ecologies. With respect to the concepts of playful places,
    socio-technical intermediaries, and protopublics we introduced above, these
    multiple durations or heterotemporalities make evident what appraisals and
    critiques of hackathons as stand-alone, solipsistic events cannot.
</p>
<p>
    Considered over time, and in conjunction with the development of a
    socially-oriented business and a wider urban context, we have identified
    three key aspects of hackathons that might otherwise escape attention: the
    establishment of playful places; socio-technical intermediaries; and
    proto-publics. These aspects resonate with the “inbetweenness” of the
    hackathon process that informed our sketches of the city. Our impressions
    highlight the overlapping communities that the hackathon process generates:
    the immediate community within and beyond Western Sydney involved in the
    intensive hackathon process (composed of socio-technical intermediaries,
    such as HACK Western Sydney and The Incubator), as well as the imagined
    communities, or protopublics, both for and beyond the intended
    beneficiaries (Parramatta and other geographical and organisational
    settings). Prototyping through play—and the intermingling drive and
    struggle—disturbs the false divide between physical and imagined
    communities, play and work, amateur and professional, as well as the real
    and the virtual. From a pragmatic perspective, hackathons are an event
    where volunteers share their knowledge and expertise so as to fix a bug,
    address an issue, and produce a shared artefact. Rich outputs generated at
    low cost means that the style of the event is increasingly adapted and
    co-opted by organisations in varying ways. However, the broader ethos, and
    that which cannot be captured, is inspired by the play and possible futures
    generated at such events: always unsettling established notions of place,
    participation, and publics.
