<h2><strong>New Modernism and Utopian Creativity</strong></h2>
<h3>Jess Wilton</h3>
<h4>University of California, Santa Barbara</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: right;">(<em>Published September 16, 2019</em>)</h4>


<p><strong>Introduction: creativity, innovation, and new modernism</strong></p>

<p><img src="img/01-Wilton.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 1. Creativity and innovation-themed banners line a construction site at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2016.</p>

<p>
    I took the photographs above in the summer of 2016 on the campus of
    Carnegie Mellon University, where the foregrounded banners decorated a
    massive construction site for a new “quadrangle” that would house the
    School of Business. They invoke the dramatic effects of creativity and
    innovation in the twenty-first century, the promise of the new amidst
    Schumpeterian ‘creative destruction.’ ‘Creativity’ and ‘innovation’
    represent a wide range of entrepreneurial trends in higher education and
    industry that humanities scholars typically associate with postmodern
    ephemerality, such as planned obsolescence and fluctuating interest rates.
    The photos are also aesthetically postmodern and representative of
    postmodernity in their tendencies toward surface over depth, present over
    past, and gesture over meaningful intervention. Despite such associations,
    this article argues that since the 1970s, a widespread embrace of
    creativity and innovation in American culture (which this image embodies)
    borrows heavily from the utopian and collective experiments of late
    nineteenth- and early twentieth-century modernism. The new modernism I will
    delineate here is industrial and economic as well as cultural and
    aesthetic, and is as prevalent in sectors like technology and higher
    education as it is in arts and performance. New modernism draws inspiration
    from the collective spaces of the modernist design workshop and literary
    salon, and in its calls for collectivity and the synthesis of theory and
    practice, it evokes utopian impulses that many scholars have mourned as
    part of postmodernism’s ostensible replacement of modernism.
</p>
<p>
    Terry Eagleton’s 1985 essay “Capitalism, Modernism, and Postmodernism” is
    exemplary of such laments. Eagleton cites Fredric Jameson’s assertion that
    postmodernism replaces parody with pastiche, and suggests instead that
    “what is parodied in postmodern culture, with its dissolution of art into
    the prevailing forms of commodity production is nothing less than the art
    of the revolutionary avant-garde” (60). In other words, postmodernism mocks
    the utopian modernist impulse to “dismantle the institutional autonomy of
    art” by erasing its political and social impulses and embracing its
    commodification (61). While Eagleton’s assessment makes sense in the
    context of the 1980s, when consumer capitalism was still dominant,
    post-millennial capitalism has more to do with social and productive
    technologies (the web, smartphones, 3D printers, etc.) that complicate the
    one-way dynamics of consumerism and enable forms of
    production-as-consumption, such as working in a maker space or blogging.
    These trends might legitimately revive the utopian impulse of
    twentieth-century avant-gardes, or merely evoke nostalgia for such
    utopianism, commodify it more convincingly, and accelerate inequality.
    Modernism and utopianism are not synonymous, either in the historical
    period of modernism in the 1910s, 20s, and 30s or in the period since 1970
    when the new modernism I describe has been ascendant. However, a “utopian
    desire for a fusion of art and social praxis” (as Eagleton puts it)
    connects these two iterations of modernism across a century of history
    (61).
</p>
<p>
    The idea of a radical break between modernism and postmodernism has already
    been thoroughly disputed, but I hope to add to that discussion by
    demonstrating a social and economic resurgence of modernism that has taken
    hold in recent celebrations of creativity and innovation. On one hand, this
    new modernism adapts the grassroots and collective impulses of modernist
    production embodied in the design workshops, small presses, and artists’
    collectives of early twentieth-century avant-gardes. On the other hand, the
    new modernism reifies both the products and the practices of its
    predecessors, in the form of maker space memberships and college hackathons
    (for instance), in which participants in the new modernism purchase their
    exploitation in the name of creativity. Furthermore, contemporary
    deployments of creativity and innovation favor the future over the past,
    invention over reason, and destruction over tradition. This kind of
    avant-garde futurism was anti-institutional in the modernist practices of
    the early twentieth century, but its new incarnation is institutionally
    entrenched. The modernist tendency to destroy and create anew is no longer
    directed against powerful institutions and corporations; rather, it is
    integral to elite universities, major corporations, and government
    policies. This does not necessarily mean that one should dismiss this new
    modernism as so much co-opted pseudo-radicalism, however. If any of its
    explosive capacity remains, its residence in the halls of power might
    render it all the more potent.
</p>
<p>
    The new modernism I describe here is closely tied to neoliberalism, so a
    significant portion of my argument will illustrate examples of
    decentralization, contingency, and self-exploitation that look to modernist
    sources for inspiration. Before doing so, however, I will provide a few
    examples from Arts-and-Crafts and modernist projects that embodied the
    utopian spirit I describe above. I will then describe three core elements
    of the new modernism that have been especially influential in
    twenty-first-century industry and higher education: makerism,
    institutionalized modernism, and minimalist selective itinerancy. In order
    to show how modernist practices regained their relevance, I will conclude
    with a brief history of the rise of creativity in the late twentieth
    century. Ultimately, I hope that sharpening the contours of the trends I
    describe here will allow the exploitative and radically transformative
    elements of the new modernism to be more effectively parsed, in both
    academic and public discourse.
</p>

<p><strong>Modernism and Utopian Practice</strong></p>
<p>
    Modernist modes of production are attractive now for similar reasons to
    those that appealed to avant-garde writers and artists in the early decades
    of the twentieth century. In their attempts to circumnavigate both mass
    culture and the rigid traditions of Victorian institutions, modernists and
    their immediate predecessors in the Arts and Crafts movement created spaces
    and networks that allowed them to support one another and operate
    independently, so that they could develop experimental aesthetics and find
    an audience for their work. Like maker spaces today, these places and
    practices offered both the appearance of disalienation as well as
    legitimate transformative potential. The paradigmatic modernist enterprise
    of the little magazine, for instance, created intimacy between authors and
    readers, as small groups of modernists produced work for each other. Yet
    this intimacy was dampened by competition for cultural capital and the
    exclusiveness of modernist networks and aesthetics.
</p>
<p>
    By disalienation, I mean the resolution of Marxian alienation from oneself,
    others, and the products of one’s labor, but the term also operates here in
    a more colloquial manner, as the antidote to the fatigue and disconnection
    that accompanied early twentieth-century modernity and its accelerations of
    cultural production, military violence, global communication, and
    transportation. Disalienation is merely apparent in the production
    practices of modernist artists because their utopian projects were only
    semi-autonomous from cultural industries such as Hollywood, Broadway, and
    Madison Avenue. Not only did they often critique and parody these
    institutions and industries; many modernists were also financially
    dependent on them. Such dependence does not erase the transformative
    potential of modernist modes of production, however. In their small
    enterprises, networks, and autonomous collectives, they modeled modes of
    utopian collectivity and alternative production that aimed for large-scale
    social and economic transformation.
</p>
<p>
    The work of William Morris provides a proto-modernist example of such
    utopian collectivity. A socialist thinker, Romantic poet, science-fiction
    novelist, and entrepreneur, Morris saw the potential for a utopian
    socialist society in which all activity contained an element of artistry,
    and the whole of the built environment could be beautiful. His
    Arts-and-Crafts philosophy and independent cultural enterprises in the late
    nineteenth century inspired many twentieth-century modernists. Morris’
    utopianism was theoretical, as expressed in his lectures and in works of
    utopian fiction like <em>News from Nowhere</em> (1890), and also practical,
    as realized in the implementation of his design and textile business Morris
    and Company. Morris and Co.’s Merton Abbey workshop, for instance, was
    designed to provide workers with a pleasurable environment and demonstrate
    an alternative to the dismal and degrading factory floors of industrial
    capitalism. As Morris’ biographer recalls, “the long low buildings with the
    clear rushing little stream running between them, and the wooden outside
    staircases leading to their upper story, have nothing about them to suggest
    the modern factory” (qtd. in Boris 9). The natural setting and practical,
    yet pleasant interior reflect Morris’ advocacy of humble work in accordance
    with organic principles of life and form. Morris sought to redeem both art
    and labor through egalitarian policies on the shop floor, as Morris scholar
    Eileen Boris’ work on the “craftsman ideal” recounts. Morris insisted on
    learning trade skills himself and hiring “unskilled enthusiasts” such as
    “boys from a nearby orphanage” and “relatives (mostly women) of friends and
    workers” (Boris 9). Utopian business practice, in this case, meant the
    transformation not only of an industry, but also the social structures
    beyond.
</p>
<p>
    Such an attempt to disalienate workers in the present suggests that Morris’
    utopianism was more modernist than Marxist, in its presumption that
    disalienation can occur through anti-establishment, autonomous creative
    practice rather than full-fledged revolution. Marx expected alienated labor
    to provoke revolution, after which the conditions for unalienated labor can
    arise, but Morris’ view is open to reordering these steps. Peter Smith’s
    introduction to <em>William Morris in the Twenty-first Century</em> (2010)
    identifies Morris’ contemporary relevance in “the struggle to address the
    false dichotomies of the practical and the aesthetic, the utilitarian and
    the poetic, the brute facticity of the real versus the capricious idealism
    of the dilettante” (136). His emphasis on the unification of theory and
    practice was influential in both the modernism that immediately followed
    Morris’ Arts and Crafts movement as well as the new post-millennial
    modernism.
</p>
<p>
    Modernists drew from Morris’ philosophy to create utopian-entrepreneurial
    environments for collective production. These modernist spaces, however,
    were more cooperative and communitarian than the entrepreneurial,
    technology-oriented maker spaces that have emerged recently
    alongside demands for creativity and innovation. For instance, Roger Fry,
    an English modernist art critic affiliated with the Bloomsbury circle,
    opened an interior design studio called The Omega Workshops in London’s
    Fitzroy Square in 1912. Its dual purpose was to counteract aesthetic
    stagnation in English interior design and to provide supplementary income
    for avant-garde Bloomsbury painters (Anscombe 31-32). Virginia Woolf’s
    biography of Fry cites one journalist’s account of the workshop: “a great
    white work-room, where one artist was at work on a ceiling, [and] another
    was painting what appeared to be ‘a very large raccoon with very flexible
    joints’ for the walls of a nursery” (195). Edward Wolfe, the “last artist
    to join the Omega,” found it to be “an extremely colourful and creatively
    exciting place, with an atmosphere that encouraged the artist to pick up
    and decorate whatever came to hand. The keynote of the Workshops was
    spontaneity” (qtd. in Anscombe 36). Like many contemporary maker spaces,
    the Omega’s interior fostered a utopian spirit of artistic freedom.
</p>
<p>
    Omega was also characteristic of modernist enterprises in its attempt to
    lift others’ fortunes, just as Sylvia Beach’s publishing and retail
    enterprise Shakespeare and Co. worked to publish such difficult-to-market
    works as James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>, and modernist little magazines,
    from the <em>Little Review</em> to the <em>Dial</em> published the work of
    writers within the editor’s modernist network. While these projects were
    fundamentally commercial, they also brought together artists whose shared
    interests included economic and racial justice, aesthetic independence, and
    other ideals conducive to political resistance. Such tendencies would be
    more pronounced in modernist formations of the 1930s like the Federal
    Theater Project, which generated radically progressive productions like
    Orson Welles’ all-black <em>Macbeth</em> and the anti-capitalist musical <em>Cradle Will Rock</em>. These attempts to evoke utopian socialism in the
    present were redirected toward anti-fascism during the 1930s and virtually
    disappeared during the Cold War. In the new modernism based on fabrication
    and coding, however, utopian impulses have reappeared.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Makerism as Institutional Modernism</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The accepted history of modernism states that during the decades following
    World War II, as the work of modernist writers became canonical in the
    teaching of American literature, its radical utopian spirit was co-opted by
    consumer capitalism. For instance, the cultural critic M. Keith Booker
    argues in <em>The Post-Utopian Imagination: American Culture in the Long 1950s</em>
    (2002) that “a number of products of American culture in the long 1950s
    demonstrate the decline of the American utopian imagination in the years
    after World War II” (3). Booker associates this decline with postmodernism,
    which suggests that the decline of utopianism parallels the decline of
    modernism and the triumph of consumerism (4). Consumerism, in turn, is one
    piece of the hegemonic Fordist economic regime of this particular period,
    which was characterized by hierarchical organization, corporate growth,
    worker protections, manufacturing, and efficiency (Harvey 125). While
    Fordism offered stability and consistency, however, it was perceived as
    stifling creativity and provoking conformity, in the intensified division
    of labor in the mid-century firm as well as the formation of homogenous
    consumer-based identities. Resistance arose quickly, however, as the germs
    of making, hacking, gigging, and corporate creativity appeared in the
    1960s, almost as soon as Fordism achieved dominance. These four trends have
    always been both resistant and consumerist, but in their
    twenty-first-century iterations, they have been fully integrated into
    dominant economic systems. The realization of anti-Fordist ideals like
    flexibility, mobility, and spontaneity has created the impression of having
    eradicated the hierarchy and conformity of Fordism and brought about a
    capitalist utopia. Although the modernism expressed here is unabashedly
    neoliberal, however, it might also be leveraged toward something more truly
    transformative.
</p>
<p>
    The DIY movement, for instance, has long been characterized by a radical
    egalitarianism that associates craftsmanship with diversity, empowerment,
    and democratization. Rebekah Willett’s brief history of the maker movement
    in a <em>Library Quarterly</em> article on makerspace discourse traces the
    current wave of library makerspaces back to the Arts and Crafts movement in
    the late nineteenth century, through the home improvement movement of the
    mid-twentieth century (itself both a rejection and embrace of consumerism),
    to the appearances of punk rock and zines in the 1970s, hackers in the
    1980s, and finally bloggers, podcasters, digital music producers, and other
    self-publishers in the twenty-first century (Willett 314-315). What unites
    many of these trends, according to Willett, is a “strong emphasis” on
    “activism and action” (316). Willett differentiates the “DIY ethic” from
    the maker movement, and argues that “the history of making, hacking, and
    DIY cultures is politically charged and concerned with the democratization
    of production processes (as opposed to industrialized production
    processes),” but the contemporary maker movement lacks such an ethic (316).
</p>
<p>
    Statistical reports from that movement’s flagship event, the San Francisco
    Bay Maker Faire, for instance, demonstrate its lack of diversity. Attendee
    studies of maker faire participants show them to be overwhelmingly white,
    male, and affluent, and note that they “tend to be male, home owners, and
    married with children; their median age is 42” (“Attendee Study”). This is
    at odds with the Maker Faire website’s declaration that “people of all ages
    and backgrounds gather to share, make, and get inspired at Maker Faires
    around the world” (makermedia.com) The critique of the maker movement’s
    lack of diversity is prevalent among critics. Granted, problems of
    exclusivity were prevalent in modernism, punk, and especially hacker
    culture. But persistent criticism of the maker movement’s demographics
    suggests that diversity is essential to this kind of project and that there
    is an abiding sense that the point of the “DIY ethic” (which hearkens back
    to Morris) is to transform the world beyond the workshop, more than to
    accomplish the enrichment of the individual.
</p>
<p>
    One reason for this individualistic turn is the rise of what I call
    “makerism,” which I differentiate from DIY and the “maker movement” in its
    tendency to emphasize the utopian gesture over active democratization.
    Makerism has taken hold in universities, corporations, and communities, as
    3D printers and laser cutters appear in libraries and corporations clear
    out cubicles to make way for the modernist open workspace. I add the “ism”
    to represent its dogmatism and differentiate “makerism” from more genuinely
    transformative maker initiatives. The “ism” also highlights tendencies to
    favor building and tinkering over reading, writing, and thinking, and to
    promote the self-actualization of the individual instead of the
    mobilization of a radical and diverse community. One way this has been
    accomplished is through the synthesis of modernism and neoliberalism, which
    is evident in many contemporary maker situations, but perhaps most visible
    in the consumer maker space.
</p>
<p>
    In the TechShop chain of maker spaces, for instance, the modernist
    transformation of theory into practice is reinvented as the synthesis of
    production and consumption. Put differently, TechShop is the consumer
    version of the utopian modernist workshop. Mark Hatch, owner of the
    maker-space chain, lays out the principles of makerism in <em>The Maker Movement Manifesto </em>(2013), in which he commands the
    reader to “MAKE. Making is fundamental to what it means to be human. We
    must make, create, and express ourselves to feel whole. There is something
    unique about making physical things. These things are like little pieces of
    us and seem to embody portions of our souls” (1). His tenets of the maker
    movement—“Make,” “Share,” “Give,” “Learn,” “Tool Up,” “Play,”
    “Participate,” Support,” and “Change”—invoke modernist collectivism. In
    this case, however, the consumer and producer are the same, as one must
    consume a membership in order to produce. Furthermore, there is an odd
    contrast between his use of the collective pronoun and his emphasis on
    self-fulfillment. “We” self-actualize through making, but it is not truly a
    collective endeavor, and certainly not political.
</p>
<p>
    Hatch’s paradoxical utopianism is also evident in his use of the manifesto,
    a quintessentially modernist genre. His “Maker Manifesto” is a 224-page
    marketing document, arranged in the form of the avant-garde manifesto. In
    the early decades of the twentieth century, avant-garde artists frequently
    declared their revolutionary intentions via manifesto, and the results
    included manifestos of Dadaism, Surrealism, Vorticism, Futurism, Cubism,
    Imagism, Expressionism, and Constructivism. As Vasiliki Kolokotroni, Jane
    Goldman, and Olga Taxidou observe, these manifestos offered “a sense of the
    modern as intervening and transformative in an international and
    revolutionary climate shaped by cataclysmic war and massive political and
    social upheaval” (xix). Hatch’s <em>Manifesto</em> is less dramatically
    revolutionary, as it channels modernist aesthetics into a colorful
    paperback, which in its graphic design resembles such classically modernist
    texts as Wyndham Lewis’ <em>Vorticist Manifesto</em> (1914)—itself once
    associated with Lewis’ short-lived maker space, The Rebel Arts Centre (see figure 2). Whereas the bold lettering, excessive punctuation, and
    dramatic arrangements of Lewis’ document were both an imitation and parody
    of print advertising, Hatch’s use of the same visual devices is an
    imitation and parody of Lewis’ parody. The <em>Maker Manifesto</em> thus
    represents much more than a simple co-optation of a revolutionary genre. If
    manifestos like Lewis’ embody the modernist tendency toward
    self-reflexivity, Hatch’s re-appropriation of the genre returns to
    sincerity and dogmatism, and the world of making he describes is a
    neoliberal utopia.
</p>
<p><img src="img/02-Wilton.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 2. Left, “Manifesto” from Blast 1, ed. Wyndham Lewis, 1914; Right, from The Maker Movement Manifesto, Mark Hatch, 2013.</p>
<p>
    To participate in Hatch’s revolution, one must embrace the
    self-exploitation that is characteristic of neoliberal instability. Each
    directive in the <em>Maker Manifesto</em> is accompanied by examples from
    the lives of real twenty-first-century makers who repeatedly sacrifice
    stability and consistent employment for the sake of making. One TechShop
    member he describes has taken an “extended ‘maker vacation’,” for instance
    (22). This man, Hatch recounts, “had saved up his money for a couple of
    years working odd jobs as a security guard and janitor, and once he had
    accrued enough money, he quit his job” to commit to making full time. This
    endeavor entailed some remarkable moments of contingency: “To stretch his
    funds,” Hatch writes, “he didn’t stay at a hotel or rent an apartment.
    Instead, he used couchsurfing.org to find free places to stay every night.
    A few times, he couldn’t find a couch, so he just slept in his car” (22).
    Rather than lamenting the dangers of such self-inflicted forms of
    itinerancy, however, Hatch celebrates the man’s ingenuity, as well as his
    value as a TechShop recruiter:
</p>
<p>
    Couch surfing turned out to be a great tool for him to help us find new
    members. He was so focused and excited that he would go “home” at night and
    tell his new couch surfing host all about what he was doing at the shop. We
    picked up half a dozen or so new members that month. We actually kicked
    around the idea of turning him into a sales representative by having him
    couch surf through the Bay Area for a couple of months. (14)
</p>
<p>
    In short, the anecdote celebrates ideas of bohemian itinerancy while
    simultaneously evading the deterioration of stable jobs for working-class
    people and the extreme inequality of the Bay area, to which this story of a
    sporadically employed service worker’s transformation into an itinerant
    maker alludes.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, makerism celebrates the fall of corporate conformity alongside
    the demise of labor solidarity. In his rejection of corporate management
    culture and Fordist institutionalism, Hatch rejects, trivializes, and
    trolls the labor movement. Another of Hatch’s makers, for instance,
    embodies the deterioration of worker protections amidst the rise of
    self-enterprise. According to Hatch, Tina Albin-Lax “made a New Year’s
    resolution” in 2012 to “make something” (13). She took a $60 laser-cutter
    class at TechShop, made a batch of cupcake toppers for her nephew’s
    birthday party, launched an Etsy store, got noticed by Martha Stewart, and
    is now a triumphant entrepreneur. Albin-Lax’s success, Hatch muses, “all
    came about from a simple desire to make something for the first time since
    sixth grade. An accidental entrepreneur was born. And what was Tina’s
    background? She was a labor organizer” (Hatch 14).
</p>
<p>
    Why does Hatch mention this? If one cannot fault Hatch for his enthusiasm
    about his own enterprise, it at least worth asking why he feels the need to
    mention Albin-Lax’s past as an advocate for workers’ rights. It suggests
    that he is aware that making is an instrument of neoliberal contingency,
    and relishes its attack on institutions that preserve worker protections.
    Throughout the <em>Manifesto</em>, Hatch is an enthusiastic proponent of
    such quintessentially post-Fordist trends as elective itinerancy,
    independent enterprise, decentralized production, and uncalculated
    risk-taking. He promotes his tenet of “play,” for instance, with an
    anecdote from his U.S. Special Forces career. In it, he and other
    servicemen decide “to cut down a tree… with a detonation cord (det-cord)
    and plastic explosive” (26). Hatch describes their plans and execution
    thereof and recalls “That was a great day, or, it was until we started a
    small fire. Live and learn. No, actually, play and learn” (27). There may
    be little harm in such “play,” and Hatch’s experimentation certainly
    embraces the avant-garde spirit, even if it incurs unnecessary damage.

<p>
    Makerists, in other words, reject traditional notions of labor organization
    and celebrate a spirit of capricious anarchy, much in the way that
    modernist artists did. There are a few crucial differences between makerism
    and modernism, however. The former focuses on individual satisfaction over
    collective benefit, as mentioned earlier. Modernism itself certainly
    grappled with this tendency as well, but the mantra of art-for-art’s-sake
    never truly referred to creation as an end in itself, nor was it truly a
    modernist invention—it comes from Aestheticism, wherein it was typically
    used ironically. Second, makerism occurs within institutions and
    corporations, while previous iterations of utopian DIY practice were
    deliberately staged outside of and against these entities. As a result,
    makerism is a philosophy that is removed from everyday life, in contrast to
    the modernist desire to unite art and the ordinary. Third, and closely
    related to the second difference, makerism is utopian in gesture but not in
    practice, because the committed utopian imagination seeks to envision
    something beyond extant structures, rather than contributing to the
    maintenance of them.
</p>
<p><strong>Institutional Modernism</strong></p>
<p>
    Of all the industrial and institutional endorsements of makerism, higher
    education’s is perhaps the strongest, as the images that precede this
    article suggest. Unlike the artistic and literary character of former
    avant-gardes, however, makerist implementations of creativity, idea
    generation, and imagination in higher education are usually limited to
    Science, Technology, Math, and Engineering (STEM) contexts. In contrast to
    the grassroots spirit of the more democratic modernisms, maker spaces in
    higher education are the province of elite institutions. Although most
    four-year institutions in the U.S. now have some sort of maker space or
    plans to initiate one, the most maker-oriented campuses are those of the
    elite technical institutes and ivy league universities that constitute the
    Higher Education Makerspaces Initiative (HEMI): U.C. Berkeley, Carnegie
    Mellon, Case Western, Georgia Tech, MIT, Olin College of Engineering,
    Stanford, and Yale.
</p>
<p>
    The discourse of university makerspaces tends to be based in action and
    practice and is often devoid of self-reflection. Whereas modernist
    collective movements tended to generate a consistently self-reflexive
    aesthetic, maker spaces are generally lacking in mission or philosophy, so
    the participant can (in theory) make anything she wants, without shared
    philosophical or aesthetic principles. Carnegie Mellon’s “IDeATe,”
    (Integrative Arts, Technology, and Design Network) program, for instance,
    does not identify as a program but rather as a “network.” IDeATe has no
    mission statement listed on its web page beyond that it “connects diverse
    strengths across CMU to advance education, research and creative practice
    in domains that merge technology and arts expertise” (“Integrated”). The
    mission statement of MIT’s MakerWorkshop emphasizes, like many of these
    initiatives, equipment and activities over purpose. The site states: “The
    mission of the MIT MakerWorkshop is to foster a student community in a
    hands-on learning environment where modeling, prototyping, and validation
    resources coexist. MIT MakerWorkshop provides space and equipment for a
    community of innovators that focus on deterministic designing and problem
    solving” (“MIT MakerWorkshop”). Georgia Tech’s Invention Studio similarly
    aims to “create environments for students to make their ideas a reality by
    providing resources for designing, prototyping, and sharing ideas through
    workshops, vendor networks, experienced guidance, and access to
    cutting-edge machines” (“Invention Studio”). This emphasis on technology,
    fabrication, and production is characteristic of the maker movement as a
    whole.
</p>
<p>
    Although the university might appear to be an ideal space in which to ask
    why and how we make, undergraduates in top-tier research universities are
    increasingly encouraged to favor production over reflection (see figure 3). A search of twelve college and university websites in
    2018, for instance, generates an (admittedly non-scientific) image of the
    verbal emphasis on making over thinking. Collective results from twelve
    schools that ranged from R1 universities to small liberal arts colleges,
    regional institutions, and community colleges reveal informative trends.
    The word “maker” appears about eight times for every mention of a
    “thinker,” while “hacker” (notwithstanding its appearance as a surname),
    “creativity,” and “entrepreneur” are all on the rise, and “innovation” is
    ubiquitous. Hackathons, in particular, have become a popular trend in
    recent years. They are essentially extended, collaborative work sessions
    during which teams of students sacrifice sleep and nutrition in order to
    bring an idea to fruition. The end result might be anything from a business
    plan to a product prototype, or even a song. The events are competitive and
    fundamentally entrepreneurial, but also are designed to foster learning and
    inclusivity. One hackathon, for instance, is described as “an opportunity
    for hackers to get together to build or modify software to create something
    that is useful, interesting or just cool… even if each participant may not
    know how to do so at the outset” (Spice, “Students”). Such inclusiveness,
    however, has the added consequence of deepening the free labor pool for the
    corporate sponsors who often retain rights to the innovations produced at
    these events.
</p>

<p id="figure">Figure 3. Action vs. Contemplation in Higher Education Today. From <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WYHmj/3/">https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WYHmj/3/</a>.</p>
<p>
    Much like TechShop encourages entrepreneurship and rejects traditional,
    stable labor models, hackathons redirect students from the acquisition and
    production of knowledge toward corporate activities like prototyping and
    disrupting. Hackathons, in other words, are part of a more widespread
    “entrepreneurship racket” that Avery Wiscomb identifies as a troublesome
    new mutation in the corporatization of higher education: “on the face of
    it,” Wiscomb argues, “experiential learning opportunities championed by
    entrepreneurial programs—and indeed much of the entrepreneurial agenda—seem
    not only practical but also beneficial to students who want to work in
    these industries. But these experiences are necessarily <em>more</em>
    beneficial to science and tech companies than to students” (Wiscomb). The
    problem of student exploitation is compounded by the rapid and anarchical
    spirit of such events, in which hacking often occurs for its own sake. As
    Sarah Brouillette argues, “even as universities praise results that lead to
    saleable intellectual properties or have economically instrumental
    applications, they show little interest in evaluating the social
    ramifications of a given innovation” (“Academic”). Some outcomes of such
    collaborations speak to the contrary, such as an Android app designed to
    read texts to the deaf in India that was developed in collaboration with
    the startup Hear to Read (Spice). To identify the transformative potential
    of a hackathon project, however, traditional academic practices of
    reflection and interpretation may be beneficial, even as they slow the pace
    of hacking.
</p>
<p>
    What is remarkable about the types of modernism that have reappeared in
    retail makerspaces and university hackathons is their modified
    institutional status. After all, this is not the first-time modernism has
    been institutionalized. After World War II, modernist literature became
    canonical across U.S. English departments, as various formalist pedagogies
    were implemented in the name of democratizing the processes of
    interpretation. From the 1950s to the 1980s, institutional modernism meant
    doing New Critical readings of <em>The Wasteland</em>. In 2018, it means
    designing apps that keep babies warm in developing countries. The stakes
    here do not lie in casting either form—or their less institutional
    predecessors—as morally superior or inferior. Instead, the juxtaposition of
    all of these modernisms might serve as a reminder that people in English
    departments have important things to add to the evolution of programs that
    champion creativity and innovation, within and beyond higher education.
</p>
<p><strong>Disorganized labor and selective itinerancy</strong></p>
<p>
    A post-Fordist corporation is most successful if it is geographically and
    structurally decentralized, and if its labor force is minimal, allowing for
    maximum flexibility in rapidly fluctuating markets. Central to these
    strategies are neoliberal values of flexibility and mobility, and reliance
    on contingent labor. New modernist elements appear in these contexts as
    well, particularly in the sector that has come to be known as the “gig
    economy” and in new lifestyle trends like itinerancy and minimalism. In
    other words, the modernist artist’s lifestyle of personal creativity and
    supplemental income has been idealized in the millennial economy. Mobility
    and precarity were preconditions of modernist production, particularly for
    American modernists in the 1920s and 1930s. Full-time, permanent attachment
    to a cultural industry obstructed modernist aesthetic autonomy, so the
    model for modernist employment was cast by writers like Sherwood Anderson,
    who abruptly abandoned his advertising career and family to write
    avant-garde novels in Chicago. Sporadic employment as contractors for film,
    theater, and news industries allowed many American modernists to live as
    European expatriates for extended periods, which ostensibly afforded them
    intellectual autonomy from their native land and its mass culture.
    Similarly, gig work and minimalist itinerancy offer twenty-first-century
    laborers alternatives to traditional industries, an oft-derided practice in
    the literature of these movements. Stability and rootedness are often
    presented as symptoms of alienated labor, as new forms of contingency
    relieve workers of the confines of permanent employment.
</p>
<p>
    The gig economy is part of a more widespread transformation in capitalism
    since 2008 that Nick Srnicek has defined as “platform capitalism.” In his
    recent evaluation of the post-2008 economy, he argues:
</p>
<p>
    The new business model that eventually emerged is a powerful new type of
    firm: the platform. Often arising out of internal needs to handle data,
    platforms became an efficient way to monopolise, extract, analyse, and use
    the increasingly large amounts of data that were being recorded. Now this
    model has come to expand across the economy, as numerous companies
    incorporate platforms: powerful technology companies (Google, Facebook, and
    Amazon), dynamic start-ups (Uber, Airbnb), [and] industrial leaders (GE,
    Siemens). (57)
</p>
<p>
    Although Srnicek (like many academic critics of neoliberalism and its
    various iterations and consequences, including me) is critical of the ways
    in which this system seems to fool workers into self-exploitation, popular
    accounts are more mixed in their assessment. Tech journalist Rana Foohar,
    for instance, argues that “the platform technologies of the ‘sharing
    economy’ might offer the possibility of empowering labor in a new way,
    creating a more inclusive and sustainable capitalism” (Foohar).
</p>
<p>
    Some popular journalists are critical of platform capitalism. Sarah
    Kessler’s <em>Fast Company</em> article “Pixel &amp; Dimed: on (Not)
    Getting By in the Gig Economy” notes “troubling issues about what it means
    to be an employee today and what rights a worker, even on an
    assignment-by-assignment basis, are entitled to.” Furthermore, she notes:
</p>
<p>
    One of the cruel ironies of the gig economy is that even though it’s geared
    almost exclusively to serve urban markets, the kind of densely packed
    cities where space is at a premium, one needs a car to have a shot at the
    cream of the work that’s available. Even worse, the universe of gig economy
    startups is mostly relying on young people and others who are
    underemployed–exactly the people whom are least likely to be able to afford
    a car in a city. Or have an extra bedroom. Or a parking space. Or designer
    clothes. Or handyman skills. (Kessler)
</p>
<p>
    The gig economy appears to make workers freer by allowing them greater
    flexibility, but falls short in practice. It also appears to resolve
    Fordist alienation, as transactions occur in an apparently simplified
    manner that places the producer and consumer in direct contact. The
    extended Fordist production chain in which a commodity or service is
    processed through numerous levels of production, distribution, marketing,
    and consumption appears to have been pared down to a few simple steps. In
    some views, these activities appear to have the capacity to empower and
    liberate individuals from the drudgery of stable employment, and could in
    some views even revolutionize capitalism itself. As an agent of
    disalienation, gig work is insufficient, as its elimination of labor
    hierarchies is illusory. There is a difference between owning the means of
    production and those of distribution, so gig workers might own couches and
    cars, but they are unlikely to seize the platforms themselves.
</p>
<p>
    Paul Mason’s <em>Postcapitalism: A Guide to Our Future</em>, however, offers
    a more traditionally utopian vision in which individuals might escape
    from—and potentially overthrow—neoliberal capitalism. He argues that the
    gig economy
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    …offers an escape route—but only if these micro-level projects are
    nurtured, promoted, and protected by a massive change in what governments
    do. This must in turn be driven by a change in our thinking about
    technology, ownership, and the work itself. When we create the elements of
    the new system we should be able to say to ourselves and others: this is no
    longer my survival mechanism, my bolt-hole from the neoliberal world, this
    is a new way of living in the process of formation. (xv)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
    Mason’s argument for the revolutionary potential of the gig economy invokes
    the modernist utopian imagination when he describes “a new way of living in
    the process of formation” and suggests the potential to collectively shape
    that formation. Furthermore, there are a few legitimate elements of
    disalienation among all the corporate smokescreens, not the least of which
    is the intensified social and affective interactions of this economy. There
    may be very little radical potential in an email conversation between an
    Etsy seller and her customer, or a Lyft driver and his rider. There is an
    affective element to this economy, however, that could be transformative
    when combined with the formation of new modes of existence. If seller,
    buyer, driver, and rider all are active and social participants in the
    development of a new economy, in other words, they might unify to influence
    that development.
</p>
<p>
    In order to differentiate the gestural and transformative elements of this
    economy, it is important to remember those whose labor is still part of the
    fetishized commodity. An Etsy transaction may appear to place producer and
    consumer in direct relation to one another, but the seller who paints “my
    pet poops breakfast” on a plastic egg container did not make the container
    or the paint, not to mention the hardware, software, and networks that make
    the transaction possible. For this economy to be truly transformative, it
    would have to somehow acknowledge the coltan miners of the Congo whose
    labor is contained in the phone used for the order, the Chinese steelworker
    whose labor is part of the Lyft driver’s car, the Silicon Valley engineer
    who coded a tiny piece of an algorithm, and many more.
</p>
<p>
    The final modernist element I wish to assert as part of a new economic
    regime is best described as elective itinerancy. The bohemian mobility of
    the Paris expatriates of the Lost Generation has re-emerged as a lifestyle
    choice that is as relevant (if not more so) to software engineers as it is
to aspiring musicians or trust fund recipients. A 2016 <em>Vice Magazine</em> article, for instance, announces that “Living out of
    a van is the new American Dream” (Jagneaux). As author David Jagneaux
    suggests, intentional homelessness is often preferable to the subsistence
    living that one ekes out in an economic climate of unprecedented
    inequality: “You could spend your youth grinding away at your job, paying
    rent and hating your life, or you could just say fuck it and move into a
    van,” Jagneaux suggests. Testimonials from so-called “vandwellers” suggest
    that economic stability is spiritually bereft, as in the example of Chris
    Trenschel and Tamara Murray, who “thought they had the perfect life”
    including successful careers, permanent housing, and expendable income, but
    “were dead inside” (qtd. in Jagneaux). Despite such inconveniences as
    “buying water jugs to urinate in, showering at gyms and rec centers, and
    just generally struggling to meet daily hygiene necessities,” vandwelling
    for Jagneaux represents a “freer, more adventure-driven lifestyle” that is
    also ideal for digital workers who can work remotely. The ideal worker
    today, it seems, wants to be “unburdened by permanent housing” as well as
    (one might assume) permanent employment (Jagneaux).
</p>
<p>
    In a similar fashion to the gig economy’s erasure of global laborers, such
    activities can be thoroughly critiqued for their accidental mockery of
    those who are itinerant but not by choice. Activities like vandwelling, in
    other words, parody states of existence that are far less liberating for
    unhomed people and migrant workers. At best, such experiences might
    activate new forms of class consciousness that permit people like the
    Trenschel-Murrays to identify with other itinerant people. The celebration
    of itinerancy as liberation, however, obstructs the already-remote
    possibility for such identification, as does the amplified individualism of
    new modernist utopian discourse.
</p>
<p><strong>Creativity as corporate modernism</strong></p>
<p>
    The final element of new modernism that is indispensable and pervasive in
    post-millennial neoliberalism is creativity. As my photographs of the
    University construction site suggest, creativity has come to represent a
    major source of accumulation and a highly valued resource. Despite
    perceptions of the mid-twentieth century as an uncreative period, the idea
    of creativity began to gain traction in everyday life nearly immediately
    during the period of dominant Fordism, and its development reveals a
    continuous and transformative streak of modernist utopianism that I argue
    is responsible for the revival of a new modernism today.
</p>
<p>
    In actuality, the word creativity was not in use at the peak of modernist
    practice. As Robert Paul Weiner notes in his comprehensive analysis of
    creativity in Western society, “the word ‘creativity’ did not exist before
    1870 and was not widely used until about 1950” (2). A search for the word
    creativity in seven of Proquest’s historical newspaper databases
    shows its dramatic proliferation in late twentieth-century American
    discourse. “Creativity” appears only a total of ten times in the entire
    first half of the twentieth century (1900-1949). It is mentioned 1,635
    times between 1950 and 1959, and then jumps to 12,550 in the 1960s; climbs
    to 21,132 in the 1970s; peaks at 37,323 in the 1990s; and stays strong in
    the 1990s at 35,222 (see figure 4). As Weiner recounts, “The fact that
    the word ‘creativity’ became common only after World War II reflects major
    historical cultural changes in the United States and beyond,” specifically
    in the arenas of business, education, and psychology (5).Weiner’s study
    associates creativity with both modernity and postmodernity. The concept of
    creativity, he states, “and the positive value we attach to it, might in
    fact be seen as hallmarks of our modern, secular, democratic, capitalistic
    society. And as our postmodern global culture expands, more and more people
    are adopting this conception as theirs, but even as they do, what we mean
    by creativity seems to be shifting” (1). He does not explore the
    connections between creativity and postmodernity, but his suspicion of a
    shift in the term’s connotations implies that creativity is modern,
    secular, and democratic throughout its iterations, but has become more
    postmodern in an era of globalization. When placed in the context of an
    ostensible break between modernism and postmodernism, however, the
    “creativity movement” Weiner describes suggests the survival of the utopian
    imagination and offers an alternative to Booker’s announcement of its
    demise.
</p>
<p><img src="img/04-Wilton.jpeg" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 4. The Rise of Creativity. From <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Bjlg8/1/">https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Bjlg8/1/</a>.</p>
<p>
    Scholars’ difficulty locating evidence of the “utopian imagination” during
    the period of historical postmodernism may have to do with its revival as
    corporate creativity. Booker’s assessment of its disappearance from
    cultural fields is apt, considering that in this period utopianism took
    refuge in the language of creativity as it was embraced by the discourses
    of industry, finance, and technology. The 1960s and 1970s were a period of
    economic prosperity followed by crisis, and as a result, new language was
    required in order to manage the radical transformation of the U.S. economy
    as it adapted to survive the shocks of the postindustrial economy.
    Creativity, as a result, came to be seen as a resource and a coping
    mechanism. In 1956, for instance, a group of “half a hundred businessmen,
    educators, and artists” gathered at the sprawling Arden estate in Harriman,
    NY to discuss “the creative process.” James N. Wallace, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>reporter sent to report on the
    conference, noted a mixture of confusion and curiosity amongst its
    participants: “With some undertones of embracing a fad,” he explains,
    “business and industry have taken up creativity and its promises of new
    products and new processes” (Wallace 1). He offers commentary from two
    industrial executives: Richard H. Andrews of Corning Glass Works, who
    remarks: “Creativity is the only way we can beat the race horse of
    increasing cost of business,” and John Amato of Sears, Roebuck, &amp; Co.,
    who observes (“with a touch of confusion”) that “creative thinking is a big
    deal today” (1). Amato’s confusion is representative of the mystique
    creativity implied in this period. A generation earlier, avant-garde
    imaginative experiments were the province of eccentric modernists that men
    like Amato might have read about in <em>Esquire</em> in an attempt to
    acquire cultural capital. In the post-utopian moment, however, creativity
    was a free agent, and corporate culture adopted modernism.
</p>
<p>
    With the rise of creative financing in the 1980s, modernist creativity
    appears to have become a foundational piece of post-Fordist global
    capitalism, as well as a source of increasing economic instability. As a
    1986 <em>LA Times</em> article titled “Home Loan Creativity Declines Along
    With Interest Rates” explains, untenably risky financing arrangements
    gained popularity in the 1980s in order to compensate for skyrocketing
    interest rates. Some of these arrangements were “so blatantly ill-conceived
    that they should never have been tried in the first place” (Campbell K1).
    Not all of these techniques fell out of use, however, as some were deemed
    “useful” and “worked reasonably well” (K1). Throughout the 1980s and 1990s,
    moreover, creativity became a resource for self-enterprise, especially when
    paired with the incipient digital economy. At this point, creativity became
    associated with the idea of the consumer-producer that now fuels the maker
    movement. A 1978 <em>LA Times</em> article titled “Computer Hobby Tests
    Limits of Creativity” calls attention to a small but growing group of
    people who have “shelled out the money for one of the new ‘personal’
    computers” (Baker CS1). The expense for such a hobby is significant, given
    that a “popular and relatively sophisticated home unit, manufactured by
    Apple Computers, Inc. in Cupertino, sells for $1,100 dollars” (CS1). Yet
    many of these hobbyists aspire to more, as they foreshadow the
    entrepreneurial spirit that has pervaded the digital economy ever since.
    Mike Golden, an unemployed resident of Torrance, CA, wants to use his new
    Apple computer to get into real estate. Engineer Donald Shiffler “wants to
    develop a program that will instruct the computer to operate an electric
    organ” (Baker 4). Many other hobbyists report similar ambitions. Creativity
    henceforth came to stand for the raw intellectual material for capital
    accumulation, on the micro level of the individual hobbyist as well as for
    the CEOs of major corporations.
</p>
<p>
    The developments I outline here suggest a departure from Srnicek’s argument
    that “in the twenty-first century advanced capitalism came to be centered
    upon extracting and using a particular kind of raw material: data” (67).
    Data are undoubtedly major sources of accumulation in this economy, but
    creativity precedes data as raw material. Data in Srincek’s description
    represents the activities of people, banked in various internet
    repositories as they shop, work, entertain themselves, and perform a
    variety of other activities. People must therefore create data, and other
    people must harvest data. Srnicek also differentiates data from knowledge,
    which he describes as “information that something happened,” as opposed to
    data, which is “information about why something happened” (67). The recent
    history of creativity, however, suggests that it is the raw material that
    generates both the data and the activities that transform data into
    accumulation, and conditions the kind of knowledge extracted from data.
</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>
    It is tempting to look back at mid-twentieth-century hegemonic Fordism with
    nostalgia, given its tendencies toward stability and apparent simplicity,
    and this article might at first seem to suggest that one should. However,
    my assertion of a new modernism suggests that the themes of apparent
    utopianism, disalienation, and the democratization of both production and
    knowledge in neoliberal discourse may not be mere postmodern simulacra of
    their modernist predecessors. The prevalence of affective labor and social
    transactions in the contemporary economy, for instance, suggest that its
    adaptations of modernist principles may still hold the potential for
    radical change. In order to realize this potential, it is important not to
    reduce the popularization of modernist, avant-garde, and countercultural
    ideas in general to familiar narratives of co-optation, or to accidentally
    renew some of the less resilient strains of Frankfurt school critical
    theory along with the modernism Theodor Adorno admired. Just as the jazz
    and Disney cartoons Adorno spurned revealed themselves to have as much (or
    more) potentially subversive power as Schoenberg’s atonal musical
    arrangements, today’s institutional modernisms may yet have transformative
    possibilities. Humanities scholars and teachers, however, have thus far
    been generally excluded from the university initiatives that invoke
    creativity, and this distance must be addressed. When possible, we should
    demonstrate the relevance of our research to the collaborative hubs,
    creative networks, and fab labs of the twenty-first-century university. And
    in addition to teaching the interpretive and critical skills in which
    humanities courses specialize, we should engage in the practices of
    creation and production that have been embraced elsewhere, so long as it is
    not at the expense of interpretive and critical learning, and especially if
    reflection and action can be reunited in the process.
