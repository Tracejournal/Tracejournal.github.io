<h2><strong>Equity by Design: Envisioning a Critical Pedagogy of Making for Educators</strong></h2>
<h3>Angela Elkordy</h3>
<h4>National Louis University</h4>

<h4>National Louis University</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: right;">(<em>Published September 18, 2019</em>)</h4>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
    Creating or making tools and solutions is intrinsic to being <em>human</em>. Interest in <em>making</em> as a practice, as well as its surrounding
    culture, has increased over the past decade, and as a phenomenon itself in
    many ways reflects the modern world in seemingly paradoxical ways. If
    considered through the high-tech lens of robotics, 3D printers, and
    wearable electronics, <em>making</em> can be viewed as embracing and
    championing technological tools. If considered through the lens of art,
    making can be interpreted as almost a longing&mdash;a celebration, in some
    sense&mdash;to return to the tactile arts, and an implied minimization of the
    technologies in our world.
</p>
<p>
    So, what exactly is <em>making</em>? The Maker Movement? The Maker Movement
    conceptualized as a highly resourced, technology-intensive set of
    activities that has profound ramifications for who can participate or who
    is excluded. Consider the implications for diverse learners who may be
    teaching at-risk students in under-resourced environments. As a
    personalized yet potentially highly collaborative set of activities with
    the power to engage learners productively in creative problem solving, the
    ideas of Making should be accessible to all learners, regardless of
    resources. As teacher educators, responsible for the training and
    development of teachers, working with graduate students who teach in a wide
    variety of contexts, we decided to explore this idea. This article shares
    our experiences.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Considering <em>Making</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The concept of <em>making</em> is complex; its implementation and
    implications are highly nuanced with significant implications for all
    learners. “As a self-defined, grassroots movement of backyard and kitchen
    tinkerers, hackers, designers and inventors, the maker movement includes a
    range of perspectives on the definitions and purposes of making” (Vossoughi
    et al, 2016). For example, creating a dress which lights up through
    embedded electronics, a smartphone stand from binder clips, hacking
existing objects to meet new purposes or designing can all be considered <em>making</em>. What is the difference between <em>making something</em>
    and Making? Who <em>makes</em>? As Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escudé note, “the
    ways making and equity are conceptualized can either restrict or expand the
    possibility that this movement will contribute to intellectually generative
    and liberatory pedagogical practices for working-class students and
    students of color” (11). Consider the defining differences in how the work
    of <em>artists</em>, <em>artisans</em> and <em>craftsmen</em> are valued
    and why one path is perceived differently, in that craftsmen are neither
    considered as <em>creative</em> or <em>original</em> as artists. The language
    surrounding making has the potential to be transformative or diminishing,
    and for learners in under-resourced contexts, this difference is crucial,
    leading either to the pursuit or rejection of making activities.
</p>
<p>
    There are several commonalities or characteristics of the maker movement
    that can be useful for educators. Modern making is illustrated in the
    following chart:
</p>
<p><img src="img/01-elkordy.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 1. Characteristics of <em>Making</em>.</p>
<p>
    Modern making has its own culture characterized by a framework, which
    includes:
</p>
<p><img src="img/02-elkordy.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 2. Attributes of Making Culture.</p>
<p>
    The premise of <em>making</em> is growing in schools and has transformative
    potential in promoting student engagement and scaffolding the development
    of critical skills and ways of thinking. These skills for college and
    career preparation in the twenty-first century include problem solving,
    collaboration, cultivation of creativity, design thinking, and
    perseverance. A successful making environment in schools can nurture the
    development of teacher and student identities as successful learners and
    problem solvers, embracing individual interests and capacities.
</p>
<p>
    In taking a critical stance on the application and outcomes of making, we
    prioritize the accessibility of the <em>Maker</em> philosophy, thinking and
    opportunities for all learners. We do this by creating a platform through
    our Maker coursework, writing, and research to share with teachers, many of
    whom work in impoverished districts, failing or troubled schools, and with
    at-risk students in the greater Chicago area. Our goal is to empower
    teachers to share with students in under-resourced schools the ways in
    which skill sets important to the success of Maker movement might be
    developed. In doing so, we hope to share the promise and possibilities of
    creative thinking, critical problem solving, and collaboration engineering.
    Teachers must become <em>Makers</em> and understand the possibilities of
    culturally relevant making using a critical pedagogy framework. This
    article discusses the context, goals, development, and outcomes of an
    online community of teacher-makers in a higher education setting in a pilot
    workshop, which embedded a critical pedagogy approach.
</p>
<p>
    We embrace the idea that “inventing, making, tinkering, designing are
    indigenous practices, that is, practices that originate and occur naturally
    in particular ecologies” (Schwartz and Gutierrez, 577, qtd. in Vossoughi,
    et al, 218). In this view, the premise is that making occurs in communities
    and is influenced by sociocultural factors, leading to an approach based in
    discovery versus a deficit-based framework that would seek to superimpose
    the dominant form of making onto all. This also leads to the ideas of
    diversity in processes, products and goals of making, and
    culturally-relevant pedagogical approaches.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Making in Schools and Predominant Practices</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The maker movement is a global movement of people who take charge of their
    lives, solve problems, and share how they solved them. This movement is
    growing in schools because these authentic learning experiences are
    engaging diverse learners in a community of making. The Internet has
    catapulted this maker movement and driven the made projects into the
    limelight. From kindergarten to second grade, students make things with
    Play-Doh, Legos, and many other materials. In the older grades, the Maker
    mindset is often diminished, due to the fact that the grade level
    curriculum does not allow for Maker time in the classroom. The Maker
    Movement is important as we understand that high levels of engagement are
    critical to the development of “lifelong learners.” This “culture of
    making” has the potential to change people into makers, instead of
    consumers. The Maker Movement has the potential to bring “technology
    people” and “non-technology people” alike into the world of creators and
    innovators. The benefits of educational makerspaces are many and varied.
    Makerspaces and <em>making</em> can have a significant impact on student
    learning and development. Making and tinkering are powerful and empowering
    ways to learn. “Ultimately, the interdisciplinary and empowering natures of
    these makerspaces can help prepare for a future we can’t yet imagine”
    (Davee, et al 10). A research study conducted by Small found that “students
    who participated in activities involving innovation were inquisitive,
    imaginative and motivated. They wanted to solve real problems that could
    help people” (qtd. in Moorefield-Lang 108). “When we allow students to
    experiment, take risks, and play with their own ideas, we give them
    permission to trust themselves, they begin to see themselves as learners
    who have good ideas and can transform their own ideas into reality”
    (Martinez and Stager 26). By putting the learner at the center of the
    educational process, each learner learns not only the content of “making,”
    but also learns about themselves. They become independent thinkers who will
    be more likely to persist in their own learning. Authentic, real-life
    experiences prompt children to learn and understand. Through such
    experiences, learners begin to work and problem-solve in a collaborative
    environment, learning important social skills alongside their peers. This
    collaborative learning helps prepare students for the their roles as adults
    in the future workplace.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Importance of Access to Maker Ideas and Practices</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A potential problem with the spread of the Maker movement in schools is the
    emerging idea of maker activities being synonymous with robotics and making
    use of other expensive technologies. This characterization has the
    potential to exclude a large number of students from these important
    activities that develop student learning capacities and attributes. This
    misconception, along with other factors occurring in minority majority
    schools, such as poor teacher quality, lack of substantive or meaningful
    access or use of instructional technologies, e.g., technology-rich but
    pedagogy-poor circumstances, restrict student access to ideas and
    pedagogical strategies to foster deep, impactful learning. The long-term
    impact of the lack of access to quality ideas, practices, and pedagogies –
    particularly when the content is perceived to be aligned with economic
    activities – is the perpetuation of poverty status with little hope for
    growth.
</p>
<p>
    In the beginning of the Maker movement there was a great deal of excitement
    both inside and outside of education. However, now the field is trying to
    determine what making looks like in various communities. One area that is
    being discussed is equity. According to Vossoughi, Escudé, and Hooper, the
    focus on equity in making is important because the involvement of a
    student’s culture in learning has a real impact on learning science and
    math. In some communities, making might be a sewing circuit group of
    students working together alongside community participants while learning
    about traditional clothing of a particular culture, and creating
    environments that model and invite students to share stories about familiar
    practices (such as kite making or home electronics repair). A number of
    scholars show the intellectual depth of everyday linguistic and cultural
    practices and the ways in which these can be meaningfully connected to
    academic concepts and identities (Gutierrez; Lee).
</p>
<p>
    When we think of making and the Maker Movement in terms of providing
    opportunities for all students, irrespective of financial circumstances, it
    is important to examine and consider the complexity of placing culture,
    power, and equity at the center of the ongoing conversation. Currently,
    making is being incorporated at scale in rapid ways without adequately
    considering the structural changes and material and pedagogical resources
    required to support learning of all students (Vossoughi, et al).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Making, Designing, Engineering</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A critical change for the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) is the
    shift to scientific and engineering practices. It has been our experience
    that teachers find the idea of integrating engineering practices into
    curricula particularly challenging. In designing our course around making
    and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) activities,
    one of our goals was to introduce engineering ideas, particularly the
    process of design thinking and working within constraints or parameters to
    solve a problem. In the process, teachers would connect their existing
    practices to the newer frameworks in a process of building upon prior
    knowledge and sense making to understand that they often <em>already</em>
    practice the core of these ideas in some form.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Preparing Teacher-Makers from a Critical Pedagogy Perspective
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our students&mdash;teacher candidates and in-service educators&mdash;live and work
    in a diverse range of contexts in the greater Chicago area, ranging from
    affluent suburbs and private schools to urban, low-performing schools where
    students (and teachers) are at risk physically, emotionally, and
    academically. Material resources available for making range from fully
    equipped technology labs with 3D printers and arrays of software and
    electronics to environments with no supplies at all. The lack of available
    time for making and design activities in under-resourced or turn-around
    school contexts&mdash;due to the restrictive curriculum focus to core subjects
    aligned with standardized testing content&mdash;is particularly concerning.
</p>
<p><img src="img/03-elkordy.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 3. Important capacities for learners developed through making.</p>
<p>
    We wanted our learners in the workshop&mdash;aspiring teacher-makers&mdash;to think
    deeply about the concepts, practices, and ways of thinking of making in
    order to successfully convey the ideas to empower <em>all</em> of their
    students. The course was carefully designed to model these practices and
    foster reflection and deep learning by immersing candidates in low or no
    cost making, tinkering, and hands-on learning activities. By diminishing
    possible barriers to participation, such as materials or equipment costs,
    we sought to make the ideas and practices&mdash;and the cognitive and affective
    benefits&mdash;easily accessible and convey that the manifestations of these
    practices are ecologically embedded.

<p>
    <strong>Our Teacher-Makers in Training</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We surveyed our ten students at the beginning of the course. Two of our students teach in pre-k through second grade, three in third through fifth grade, one in middle school, one in high school, two in special settings&mdash;sheltered kindergarten, special education, early childhood&mdash;and one as a college professor. We
    surveyed our students regarding their confidence in teaching technology
    content. The making content can be scaled to transcend technology skills
    and can be applied in intergenerational contexts. Our survey showed that
    initially, 20 percent of our group were not really confident in their
    technology expertise, 20 percent were confident but a little unsure of
    their technology expertise, 40 percent were neutral, and 20 percent of our
    students were confident in their technology expertise. Throughout the
    course, our teacher-learners gained both an expanded view of technology and
    confidence in its use.
</p>
<p>
    Another area on which we surveyed our students was their strengths as
    learners. We found that our students were eager to learn new things,
    curious and organized, loved teaching, knew their preferences in learning
    (visual/auditory learners), enjoyed observing other teachers, and were
    reflective educators. This survey information helped us get to know our
    students at a deeper level as we learned together during our course.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Pedagogical Approach: Course Practices</strong>
</p>
<p><img src="img/04-elkordy.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 4. Course practices.</p>
<p>
    Education research has consistently viewed community as critical to support
    collaborative learning and discourse associated with higher levels of
    learning. The nature of online communication and the probability for
    disconnectedness has focused attention on the issue of community building.
    There is evidence that a sense of community is significantly associated
    with perceived learning (Shea).
</p>
<p>
    In developing our course, we kept in mind the tenets of a community of
    inquiry model, paying attention to social, teaching, and cognitive presence
    (Garrison and Archer). Specifically, we focused on purposeful creation of
    community, knowledge co-creation and sharing of mental models, modeling,
    clear expectations and scaffolding learning, reflection through journaling,
    and student feedback. We also created our course with low-cost making
    projects in mind to benefit all the learners we taught.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Purposeful Creation of Community</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In designing our course, we started with an online discussion forum to
    introduce all of us to each other. Sample questions included: Who are you?
    What do you teach? What do you hope to learn? What are your summer
    adventures? and What are you making this summer? Our students are a diverse
    group of teachers&mdash;kindergarten, elementary, middle school math, special
    education, high school (Art and Tech), and a college professor. They also
    are diverse in school contexts&mdash;private and public schools, suburban and
    urban. We were able to begin building purposeful, meaningful relationships
    with our students during our first online discussion.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Knowledge Co-creation and Sharing of Mental Models</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We required weekly online discussions where we participated and learned
    with our students, thus co-constructing knowledge together. We were
    reminded as we worked with our students that both scaffolding and modeling
    are essential for learners to engage in these complex processes. Taking
    time during the initial design process of the course to think through what
    learners are expected to know and be able to do by the end of course
    facilitated the co-construction of knowledge through our weekly
    discussions. This process helped us understand our learners better,
    strengthening the learning experience for all of our students.
</p>
<p>
    We shared mental models of content throughout the online modules we
    designed. In this way, the teachers’ experience was a reflection of what we
    hoped our candidates would do in their own classrooms.

<p>
    We invited teachers to Hack the Classroom by creating new materials they
    needed for the forthcoming school year. Jennifer, a first-grade teacher,
    created her own instructional materials:

<p id="figure">Figure 11. Colorful books with velcro letters.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Clear Expectations and Interactive Modeling</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It was important to consistently model for our students during our online
    work together. The teachers’ experiences were a reflection of what we hoped
    they would do in the classroom and the modeling provided them with a visual
    that they could carry into the classroom. Developing our course with
    interactive modeling in mind not only facilitated our students’ learning,
    but also helped them learn exactly why the procedure was important to
    engage their students in active learning.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Scaffolding Development Around an Accessible Model of <em>Making</em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We used the LAUNCH framework (a K-12 Design Thinking Framework; see Juliani
    and Spencer) as the course text. This framework guided our work with our
    students and included instructional supports and a clear introduction to
    the design process. The steps of the LAUNCH cycle are as follows:
</p>
<p><ul class="a" style="list-style-type:none;">

    <li><strong>L</strong>
    ook, listen and learn</li>
    <li><strong>A</strong>
    sk tons of questions</li>
    <li><strong>U</strong>
    nderstand the process or problem</li>
    <li><strong>N</strong>
    avigate ideas</li>
    <li><strong>C</strong>
    reate a prototype</li>
    <li><strong>H</strong>
    ighlight and fix, then&mdash;LAUNCH to an audience</li>
    <li><br> </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
    By implementing this technique in our course, we tapped into our students’
    curiosity and allowed them to test, create, and recreate until they were
    eventually able to design the final project to share with one another.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Design Challenges through Teacher Tinker Exercises</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The design challenges in our course were built around low-cost objects and
    aligned with NGSS practices. Our students experienced the ideas of making
    through a distributed Maker community. Our Teacher Tinker Design Challenges
    included a Robot Hand Science Project, a Cardboard Challenge, Hacking the
    Classroom, and Tinkering with Time. It was exciting to experience the
    learning journey with our students as they deconstructed and examined the
    ideas together, both through scaffolded online discussion posts and during
    Zoom web-conferencing sessions. Their final projects as Teachers Tinkering
    was evidence of deep learning and understanding of the course objectives.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Reflection through Journaling</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Journal writing benefits students by enhancing reflection, facilitating
    critical thought, and helping the writer understand their own metacognitive
    processes in learning new content. Additionally, the discussion boards and
    multimedia digital journals threaded throughout the course helped the
    students deconstruct their making experiences. It was powerful for us at
    the end of the course to reread our student journals describing each
    individual student’s learning journey as well as perspectives on making
    from such a diverse group of students covering a wide grade span of
    teaching: kindergarten to undergraduate.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Student Feedback</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We designed our course with ongoing formative assessment in mind. Our
    journal topics included: Teacher Tinker activities, Journey to Making, and
    a final STEAM project design plan. The feedback we gave our students was
    ongoing and individualized based on the learners’ respective prior
    knowledge and the outcome of each weekly module. Our questions included
    “thinking about your thinking,” e.g., “Did you follow instructions, if so,
    what format did you follow, verbal, from a person, video or other digital
    media, blog post. If you were ever to try this again, what changes would
    you make?” We also asked our students to reflect on prior experiences and
    how their experience in our course differed from other courses. Through our
    course boards, discussions, and surveys we provided ongoing formative
    feedback to our students during our time together. Our final design
    projects reflected the impact of this feedback loop, especially when the
    students shared their final projects with all of us. By sharing our
    projects, we gave a purpose to the work, and students had an opportunity to
    explain their thinking online with each other. Additionally, it gave
    students the opportunity to see their projects with new eyes, and they were
    able to revise if necessary.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Designing Maker Activities from a Critical Pedagogy Perspective
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The critical pedagogy perspective for making is assisting students of all
    ages to question and problem-solve. From a teaching and learning
    perspective, this translates to giving students agency. Their capacity to
    act on objects and technologies rests in the belief that the relationship
    between learning and the objects are malleable (Bullock). Learning through
    the making of things is constructivism in action. If you are working with
    learners in a maker space, you are a facilitator of constructivism.
</p>
<p>
    Another important component of the Maker Movement and critical pedagogy is
    access to ideas. The rapidly changing demographics of our classrooms has
    resulted in linguistic and cultural diversity across the United States.
    Advocates of critical pedagogy assert that teachers must become learners
    alongside their students. As we become learners, we are learning about our
    students’ cultures and have opportunities through the Maker Movement to
    learn about the culture, customs, and lived experiences of our students.
</p>
<p>
    To most, a Maker is someone who makes things. Creating a community where
    makers can come together around powerful ideas is a critical aspect of the
    Maker movement. As one of our students noted, time spent in Make Space
    activities “helps us understand what we are capable of.” The Maker Movement
    offers the potential to make classrooms more student-centered, relevant,
    and sensitive to the strengths of each individual learner. We saw firsthand
    the importance of creating a Maker Community in our online course where all
    students problem solve, create, and design together and share their
    thinking.
</p>
<p>
    Every classroom can become a makerspace where students and teachers can
    learn together through direct experience with an assortment of high and
    low-tech materials (Martinez and Stager). Though we hear more about 3D
    printers and other expensive materials in Maker Spaces, we were able to
    provide out students with a beneficial experience by keeping the costs of
    materials to a minimum. We found that our students were creative in finding
    materials at home or outside that were low cost. We discovered together
    that cardboard is a great resource for Maker projects: tissue boxes, toilet
    paper rolls, and boxes became our favorite materials. Also, straws, plastic
    bottles and jars, and containers were very useful. Once we looked around,
    we realized that low cost Maker activities were possible. As we found, even
    the simplest projects deserved the spotlight, and we think that even our
    students were surprised at what they were able to accomplish with low tech
    Maker materials.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Teacher Tinker Projects</strong>
</p>
<p>
    An assignment that we created for our students was nested in the theme of
    Teacher Tinker projects. We added the following prompts for the students to
    facilitate sharing in our online course: “Take pictures as you work though
    the instructions (minimum 3), then reflect on your design process. What
    questions did you have? How did you resolve any issues? did you try more
    than once? how did you feel as you moved through the project? Post your
    pics and responses here in this discussion thread&mdash;or if you chose to blog
    about it, please share the link here. Respond to at least one colleague.”
</p>
<p>
    The students shared their final projects: Robotic Hand, Cardboard
    Challenge, and Hacking the Classroom. The students created a wide variety
    of projects using low-tech, low-cost materials, as well as projects
    involving family members and drawing upon summer experiences. The students
    appreciated the opportunity to create low-tech projects with family
    members, using materials at their fingertips.
</p>

    <strong>Maker Musings: Reflection Blog</strong>
</p>
<p>
    An activity that particularly resonated with the teacher-makers was a task
    to design a solution to a problem encountered in a literature source they
    used with students. They were asked to select a book from the Novel
    Engineering website that was designed and supported by Tufts University’s
    Center for Engineering Education and Outreach. Integrating the idea of
    literacy and authentic problem solving into the task of teaching
    engineering practices allows teachers to build upon familiar practices with
    confidence. Here are two exceptional examples from one of our
    teacher-makers:
</p>
<p>
1. “For this activity, I decided to use the book <em>A Long Walk to Water</em> by Linda Sue Park. The character in this
    story, Nya, walks long distances to retrieve water [in Sudan]. One of the
    problems identified by students was the lack of necessary shoes. For my
    ‘make’ I decided to work with my daughter to design a shoe which would be
    easy to repair and would keep thorns out. We used items we found around the
    house. We made them out of cardboard, reinforced with three layers of
    foam.”
</p>
<p>
    2. “It is the Colonial Era (1565-1776) and one of the problems the people
    face is a lack of clean water. Below are several pictures of a filtration
    system I tried out that involves heat and my background knowledge of the
water cycle. This maker activity was inspired by the book <em>If You Lived in Colonial Times</em>.”
</p>

<p><img src="img/14-elkordy.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 16. “Collect the dirty water. Heat it up in a kettle and cover the top tightly with aluminum foil. Leave
    the opening uncovered for the next step.”</p>

<p id="figure">Figure 20. Envisioning a critical pedagogy for Making in schools</p>

<p>
    In the spirit of design-thinking, we have several ideas for modifications
    to our course and pedagogical framework to describe, convey, and practice a
    critical pedagogy suitable for our teacher-makers to implement in their
    classrooms. Some of our next steps are to:
</p>
<p>
  <ul class="a">
  <li>Continue developing and expanding the online, collaborative aspects of
    the course, including small group work and participant meetings outside of
    the class meetings.</li>
  <li>Encourage teachers to explore – through purposeful discovery – the
    cultural objects, processes, and practices of making in their students’
    communities.</li>
  <li>Conduct our own research to understand the impact of teachers who were in
    the course and in future workshops.</li>
  <li>Redesign the workshop to include greater emphasis on Critical Pedagogy
    through readings and reflections.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Ten Tips for Educators Interested in Establishing an Authentically
        Inclusive Maker Program or Activities
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Your learners are already makers and have family who
        are <em>Makers</em>. </strong>Connect to prior knowledge and experience. This is a great place to
    fit in some culturally appropriate pedagogy. For example, learning how to
    roll stuffed grape leaves is an iterative practice for Middle Eastern
    families.</li>
    <li><strong>A crucial component of making is the unique features of <em>Maker</em>
        communities.</strong> Designing the environment for equity and inclusion takes purposeful
    planning and is ecologically based. What kinds of resources and constraints
    are in the learning context? What funds of knowledge can your learners
    leverage as strengths?</li>
    <li><strong>Encourages the 4 Cs (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and
        community).</strong> These are essential skills for <em>all</em> digital age students, even if
    their access to digital technologies is limited.</li>
    <li><strong>Making is experienced and enacted through a social lens.</strong> Explicitly teach and model skills required to successfully participate
    in communities of makers, for example, how to be accepting, encouraging,
    and collaborative.</li>
    <li><strong>Understand that <em>making or tinkering</em> and <em>making something</em> can be very different.</strong> Creativity needs a springboard, an authentic purpose or problem, and
    requires structure or a goal. Our teacher-makers found that they struggled
    to “find something to make” while approaching the goal-oriented problem of
    our design-challenges quite differently.</li>
    <li><strong>Remember that <em>Engineering</em> is solving a problem within specifications or constraints.</strong> Keep design-challenges simple initially and build upon existing
    practices or content areas, for example, language learning, history, or
    social sciences in addition to traditional <em>science</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Use low- or no-cost materials to start</strong>. Using cardboard, binder clips, office supplies, or recycled materials
    does not diminish the ideas and practices of making.</li>
    <li><strong>Teach a framework for design thinking.</strong> Create connections to unpack the design processes and make them <em>visible</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Characterize familiar processes as parts of the design cycle to promote understanding.</strong> Ask probing question about the makers in student families and how they
    refine practices or products. For example, what kinds of problems are
    encountered when learning how to make stuffed grape leaves? How are the
    issues resolved?</li>
    <li><strong>Share explicit examples for community-building questions and practices.</strong> Model how to ask probing questions to prompt reflection and create
    shared values.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    Our teacher-learners were excited to share their ideas with their own
    students. They regarded the ideas of the Maker and design course as
    Important (75%) or Very important with the potential to be transformative
    (25%). In their own words:
</p>
<ul class="a">
    <li>
        “I am definitely going to incorporate design thinking into my literacy
        studies as it is connected to language development.”
    </li>
    <li>
        “Well, my work will revolve around letting teacher candidates better
        understand how their information on design thinking will and can impact
        their teaching and their classrooms.”
    </li>
    <li>
        “I am implementing it [Maker ideas] into my provocation centers and
        Passion Projects.”
    </li>
    <li>
        “The ideas of creating and designing are easily incorporated into my
        teaching because I want to stress exploration and resilience in our
        classroom. It is important that my students learn that it is okay to
        make mistakes and they are an important part of the learning process.”
    </li>
    <li>
        “Allow time for students to work together through challenges that
        require failure leading to success.”
    </li>
    <li>
        “I can incorporate more inquiry-based lessons in which students need to
        work collaboratively with their peers to come up with a solution to a
        problem. We will go through the design thinking process as a group
        while explicitly showing what sorts of things you should do at each
        stage, and then I will have the kids go through it in groups.”
    </li>
    <li>
        “[I will] focus on the discovery and interpretation parts.” “By tying
        more of what we do to real world problems, especially ones that
        students are concerned about.”
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Making is participatory learning through which learners can leverage their
    own funds of knowledge while collaborating with others. Carefully designed,
    contextually bound Maker activities can be powerful in their capacity to be
    inclusive, authentic, and celebratory of diverse talents and inquiries:
</p>
<p>
    Making has never felt so relaxing. It has given me the chance to involve my
    family members, especially those who have always felt incompetent because
    of their lack of education. I cannot express in words how good it felt to
    see my father's face light up when I asked him to help me set up my brand
    new folding pocket knife. He has never felt so useful when it comes to my
    academic work. (English as a Second Language Teacher-learner)
</p>
<p>
    Through the course, our teacher-learners collaborated to share concepts,
    procedures, questions, and processes. Perhaps most importantly, their
    conceptualization of Making and the development of successful learning
    habits&mdash;such as critical problem identification and solving, persistence,
    curiosity, and agency&mdash;has potential to become a pedagogy of equity and
    inclusion.
