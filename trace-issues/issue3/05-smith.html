<h2><strong>“Delivering” Critical Making:  Exploring Rhetorical Delivery’s Impact on the “Maker” Project</strong></h2>
<h3>Steven Smith</h3>
<h4>North Carolina State University</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: right;">(<em>Published September 18, 2019</em>)</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Musical Vitality” is a project I developed with a group of undergraduate
    students in the course “Digital Rhetoric (and Writing) with Arduino and
    Processing” at North Carolina State University. This 300-level course was
    primarily designed with juniors and seniors in mind and had a goal of
    teaching students how to create touch-based, interactive projects which
    were aimed to be rhetorically persuasive towards an audience. Using items
    like an Adafruit 12 x Capacitive Touch Sensor, conductive paint, an Arduino
    Uno, and copper wire, and bolstered through practical experience in
    Processing (a coding language typically used by visual designers), students
    would create projects using audio, video, text, and images in an attempt to
    blur the line between the digital and physical through their hand-made
    projects. After a semester-long endeavor of studying Processing and
    physical computing practices (soldering, wiring, implementation of code,
    etc.), students collaborated in groups to create various attention-getting
    projects, such as a capacitive touch painted door that, when opened,
    projected an image of an alternate reality or an interactive installation
    of music (explored more fully in this article).
</p>
<p>
    The inclusion of physical computing practices in the classroom at North
    Carolina State University is justified by teaching students the aspects of
    “digital” rhetorical persuasion and is achieved by exploring how rhetoric
    is often practiced in the digital era; that is, we must go beyond pen,
    paper, and even works regarding the use of the personal computer and
    explore other avenues of rhetorical persuasion–in this case, those which
    braid digital and analog systems together. Through this eversion, or the
    “hybridization that now characterizes the relationship between cyberspace
    and the physical realm,” as it is often referred to as in
    maker-scholarship, student outcomes were to gain knowledge in physical
    computing practices, create persuasive projects, and understand how to
    translate ideas from print to digitally-interactive media (Rieder 5).
</p>
<p>
    The approaches to teaching digital rhetoric in this context—that is,
    through the inclusion of digital technologies and physical computing—draws
    inspiration from the constructionist theory of education developed by
    Seymour Papert and Idit Harel. This theory “emphasizes the importance of
    actively making things” and “gives prominence to how the learner’s logical
    reasoning and emotion-driven reasons for engagement are inseparable” (Ratto
    254; Mackrell and Pratt 419). Through constructionism, one uses physical
    objects “as a way of connecting to the sensorimotor ‘body knowledge’ of a
    learner to more abstract understandings” while seeking to “overcome to the
    ‘rigid’ style of work typically associated with [computers]” (Ratto 245).
    The relationship between critical making and constructionism, however,
    should focus on “social concepts and scholarly work, rather than math,
    science, or engineering” (254).
</p>
<p>
    In “Digital Rhetoric (and Writing) with Arduino and Processing,” the
    emphasis is not necessarily on the teaching of rhetoric, but rather on
    coding and the physical manipulation of objects; additionally, it stresses
    the relationship between the body (making) and computers and allows for
    students to work with basic engineering principles such as wiring. That
    said, the underlying <em>theme</em> of the course was still for students to
    grasp an understanding of how these practices could lead to digital,
    rhetorically persuasive projects. The written components required with each
    major assignment allowed for students to reflect on their projects
    regarding <em>how</em> the project was made, as well as the rhetorical
    implications that the project could have on an audience. The success of
    this maker-oriented classroom comes not only from the objects that are
    crafted (though there is surely a sense of self-pride amongst students for
    completing these projects), but also from the reflective pieces written on
    those projects which showcase the students’ understanding of what it means
    to create digital, rhetorically persuasive objects.
</p>
<p>
    Take, for example, a rather simple project crafted by myself and three
    other undergraduate students in the class called “Musical Vitality.” This
    installation was first an interactive disc jockey (DJ) table written solely
    in the Processing program. When the file was opened, the viewer was
    presented with a DJ table, and as s/he moved the cursor (which was overlaid
    with a hand) across the board, different sounds that are often associated
    with DJs played; for example, when the cursor-hand is moved across the
    turntables, then the sound of a record being “scratched” is heard. Other
    interactive noises embedded in the file include a kickdrum, laser-beam, and
    a bass note that is reminiscent of today’s electronic music.
</p>
<p><img src="img/01-smith.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 1. Interactive DJ Table.</p>

<p>
    As the project continued, it slowly developed from a digitally interactive
    experience to one that would respond to the analog world via touch—a kind
of “DIY” version of popular games akin to <em>Guitar Hero</em> or <em>Donkey Konga</em>. This was accomplished via the continued use of
    Processing and the inclusion of the Arduino Mega 2560, a microcontroller
    used in the creation of digital devices that can be physically manipulated
    by the user. Although the initial plan was to continue the development of
    the DJ table, these prospects changed, as do many maker projects, when the
    opportunity arose to present the project at “Matters of Media,” a showcase
    of North Carolina State University student media projects. The construction
    of a physical DJ table was scrapped, and the lighthearted sounds embedded
    in the code were replaced with various popular songs that would activate
    when a participant would physically touch their switch.
</p>
<p>
    The multisensory project that is “Musical Vitality” seeks to explore the
    rhetorical conventions and implications of <em>digital</em> delivery and
    rhetoric via critical making. To achieve this, ten containers, each a
    different color, are placed on a flat surface. The top of each container is
    not only equipped with one thin strip of copper paint that goes down the
    side of the container, but it is also painted with electrical paint which
    allows the surface to be sensed by touch. For each container, an alligator
    clip is connected to the copper tape, which is then connected to a Bare
    Conductive Touch Board; this allows for an electrical current to run from
    the electrical paint and be registered by the Touch Board. For aesthetic
    purposes, an LED was placed in each container and two copper wires were
    soldered to each leg of the LED, which were then connected to various
    digital inputs found on an Arduino Mega 2560. The LEDs were coded to fade
    in and out according to the pace of the music. Lyrics to each chosen song
    were printed on transparent paper and placed inside of each container so
    users could read the lyrics; this also allowed for the LEDs to brightly
    shine. Once the sound files were uploaded to the Touch Board, and the code
    that was written in the Arduino software was uploaded to the Mega 2560, a
    viewer could simply place their hand on the top of each container to
    activate the installation.
</p>
<p>
    As a project that follows the conventions of Matt Ratto’s definition of
    critical making, or the “act of using material forms of engagement with
    technologies to supplement and extend critical reflection and, in doing so,
    to reconnect our lived experiences with technologies to social and
    conceptual critique,” “Musical Vitality” draws design elements from the
    rhetorical canon of delivery (Ratto 253). In particular, I draw from
    contemporary delivery via the works of Robert J. Connors (1983), Collin
Gifford Brooke (2009), and Sean Morey (2015) and the ways that digital delivery can be used as a means to create a rhetorically
    persuasive installation. Before introducing the instruction set for
    “Musical Vitality” and how principles of rhetorical delivery may be used in
    critical making, perhaps it is best to fully articulate the potential
    relationship between rhetorical delivery and critical making, beginning
    with a brief overview of delivery traditions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>“Delivering” Critical Making</strong>
</p>
<p>
According to Richard A. Lanham in his 1991 work <em>A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms</em>, the original canon of delivery was
    divided into two parts: voice and gesture. The former of these
    subdivisions, voice, was necessary for oration in the classical period
    given that venues of the time were unamplified, thus requiring the orator
    to develop strong lungs and an ability to project messages clearly across
    enormous amounts of space. The latter subdivision, gesture, focused on a
    directory of hand positions and body poses, which was most prominently
taken up by modern history rhetoricians such as John Bulwer in <em>Chirologia: or the Natural Language of the Hand </em> (1644) or Gilbert
    Austin in <em>Chironomia, or a Treatise on Rhetorical Delivery</em> (1806).
</p>
<p>
    Contemporary scholars of rhetorical delivery have begun to explore the
    implications of digital technologies and their potential impact on the
undervalued canon. For example, in his work “<em>Actio</em>: A Rhetoric of Manuscripts,” Robert J. Connors attempts to
    place delivery in relation to writing as the “format and conventions of the
    final manuscript as it is sent in, handed in, or given up” (64). He argues
    that delivery, in regard to print format, is split up into three
    categories, type/typefaces, paper, and typography/layout, and that each of
    these categories impacts the ways in which a reader comprehends a document.
    Although the argument could be made that the manipulation of
    type/typefaces, paper, and typography/layout are elements of style,
    Connors’ attempt at reinventing delivery in writing practices is admirable,
    though perhaps outdated given its 1983 publication date.
</p>
<p>
    Collin Gifford Brooke has also sought to revive delivery, but in the context of new media. In
chapter 7 of his work <em>Lingua Fracta: Towards a Rhetoric of New Media</em>, Brooke makes
the argument that scholars should see delivery as both a practice <em>and</em> a performance, as opposed to its traditional roots as a
        transitive process between a speaker and audience. Keeping in mind the idea from classical antiquity that successful
        delivery requires good personal character (<em>ethos</em>), Brooke
        believes that online, interconnected media can cultivate performative
        environments that allow for the transmission of information. To justify
        this theory, he cites two examples (one from a personal blog, and
        another a critique of Wikipedia) demonstrating how anonymous online
        users establish <em>ethos</em> by delivering credible content to
        open-source interfaces such as Wikipedia. Delivery in new media, then,
        is the <em>act</em> of establishing ethos in networked environments and
        using that credibility to create discourse capable of circulation.
    </a>
</p>
<p>
Both “<em>Actio</em>: A Rhetoric of Manuscripts” and <em>Lingua Fracta</em> are undoubtedly valuable works on delivery, but each
    misses the opportunity to explore the traditional aspects of voice,
    gesture, and general manipulation of the body. As such, Sean Morey’s book <em>Rhetorical Delivery and Digital Technologies: Networks, Affect,
        Electracy</em> seeks to address the ways that delivery and digital technologies interact
    with one another; this approach allows scholars to reevaluate the
    relationship between delivery, online discourse, and embodiment. While the
    entire book is dedicated to the relationship between technology and
delivery, of particular importance is his inclusion of the theory <em>posthumanism</em>, wherein he argues that digital technologies are a
    kind of prosthesis to the hand that allow delivery to extend through
    cyberspace networks. For Morey, the idea of delivery still very much
    involves the body but with an emphasis of the body’s extension into
    virtuality. The significance of the reciprocal relationship between the
    “deliverer” and “audience” is still stressed, and it is ultimately the
    connection between deliverer/audience/digital technology that blend
    together and push us to become <em>posthuman</em>.
</p>
<p>
    There are, of course, other works that delve into digital delivery,
    including Kathleen Welch (1999), James E. Porter (2009), Ben McCorkle
    (2012), and Douglas Eyman (2015), but for my particular critical making
    project I found the bulk of the inspiration primarily came from Connors
    (1983), Brooke (2009), and Morey (2015) while focusing more on the
embodied/gestural aspects of delivery than the vocal. In his work “<em>Actio</em>: A Rhetoric of Manuscripts,” for example, Connors asks the
    vital question “what can a writer do in terms of the physical object she
    presents to the reader that will affect that reader’s disposition toward
    her and her message?” (65). Such a question could lead to the consideration
    of the <em>physical</em> makeup of a project wherein a specific font, size,
    and or overall general layout should be considered so that a participant
    could, as per the suggestion of Connors, “concentrate on the comprehension”
    of the installation (72). Likewise, Brooke’s analysis that interconnected
    media, such as the media of our body, the construction of the project, and
    the naked networks that connect their interaction, may allow for
    information transmission between <em>actor</em> (the installation) and
    <em>audience</em> (participant)&mdash;from a rhetorical perspective, this would ideally
entice participant engagement which would, in turn, increase the maker’s <em>ethos</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, though, Sean Morey’s inclusion of posthumanism and its
    application to digital delivery offer what I believe to be the biggest
    contribution to critical making, at least pertaining to “Musical Vitality.”
    For example, early in his work <em>Rhetorical Delivery and Digital Technologies: Network, Affect,
        Electracy</em>, Morey writes that “digital writing technologies—through which the body
    again becomes visible and telepresent—invite a reevaluation about what
    delivery can offer rhetorical studies and writing practices” (1). Although
    he is referring to digital technologies in their entirety, more specific
    examples could be augmented reality technologies, virtual reality, global
    position systems (GPS), or even those mentioned throughout this research,
    such as the Arduino Uno and capacitive touch shields. His theory on
    delivery largely draws from classical notions of the canon and posthuman
    scholarship via the work of Donna Haraway and N. Katherine Hayles and seeks
    to resituate delivery “within current writing technologies” (8). Digital
    delivery’s emphasis on <em>current</em> digital writing technologies allows
    for a reevaluation of what “written” scholarship should view as writing; no
    longer should scholars of rhetoric be constrained to word-based writing
    systems, but instead they should seek to explore other avenues, like those
    used by computer programmers—for example, Processing.
</p>
<p>
    His inclusion of the theory of posthumanism may also provide interesting
    insight on the relationship and viability between critical making and
    digital rhetoric. Morey believes that, through digital technologies and
    theories of posthumanism, we are using the tools of delivery to create “an
    affective attunement with the audience” (216). The assemblages that a
    deliverer, or creator of an installation in this case, create ultimately
    “extends to the audience within/throughout a rhizomatic structure” and
    because of that, “digital delivery requires not just a performance of the
    deliverer, but it requires the audience to perform and take a role in the
    delivery process” (220). Thus, for digital delivery to occur, there needs
    to be a reciprocal relationship between the deliverer and the audience, and
    this is accomplished through that which is being delivered. The result of
    this process would be the rhetorical impact that transmission has on the
    audience.
</p>
<p>
    While this section sought to explore the relationship between critical
    making and rhetorical delivery, subsequent sections offer an instruction
    set of the installation “Musical Vitality,” and an analysis of the
    installation via the principles of rhetorical delivery that were considered
    from Robert J. Connors, Collin Gifford Brooke, and Sean Morey. On a grander
    scale, this analysis ideally shows how rhetorical delivery could be used
    during the design phase of a critical making project.

    <strong>Instruction Set</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Required Materials</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Many of the items here can be purchased in a bundle package from the
Adafruit online store. For example, purchasing an Arduino Uno<sup>1</sup> comes with a breadboard, wire bundle,
    and several 5mm LEDs.
</p>
<ul class="a" style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>1 – Arduino Mega 2560 <strong>or</strong> Arduino Uno</li>
    <li>1 – soldering iron and roll of solder</li>
    <li>1 – breadboard</li>
    <li>1 – breadboarding wire bundle</li>
    <li>12 – short wire alligator clips</li>
    <li>1 – spool of 20 gauge copper wire (scale of project will determine size of spool)</li>
    <li>1 – copper foil tape with conductive adhesive</li>
    <li>1 – LED mixed bag – 10mm (10mm LEDs may be substituted with 5mm LEDs)</li>
    <li>1 – Bare Conductive paint pen – 10mL</li>
    <li>11 – multicolored (or clear) containers</li>
    <li>1 – speaker system <strong>or</strong> computer with speakers (laptop preferred for transportation)</li>
    <li>1 – USB A to B cable</li>
    <li>1 – Bare Conductive Touch Board</li>
    <li>1 – auxiliary cable</li>
    <li>1 – microSD card</li>
    <li>11 – pieces of construction paper cut into small circles (the thicker the better)</li>
    <li>1 – stick of glue (superglue works best)</li>
    <li>1 – paintbrush (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Digital Instructions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This portion of the installation involves uploading the code to the Arduino
    and the desired songs/sounds to the Bare Conductive Touch Board.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step One: Acquiring the Sketch</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To begin, visit the sketch LED link <a href="https://gist.github.com/slsmit17/47819c30fcdc6a782438d2a28a72fa1e">here</a> and download the Arduino code that is necessary to activate the LEDs.
</p>
<p>
    Once the code has been downloaded, simply copy and paste it into a blank
    Arduino sketch. With your Arduino plugged in, click the “Upload” button.
    You may alter the code as you wish by changing the brightness of the LEDs
    or the rate at which each fades. For my project, I counted the time
    signature of each song and manipulated the code so that the LEDs faded in
    sync with the beat of the song.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Two: Adding .mp3s to the Bare Conductive Touch Board</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is a relatively simple process. For the best directions, click
    <a
        href="https://www.bareconductive.com/make/changing-the-mp3s-on-the-micro-sd-card/"
    >
        here</a>. Depending on your project, you may include sound effects, songs, or any
    kind of .mp3 file you wish.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>LED Instructions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Wiring for the LEDs is likely the most time-intensive part of this project,
    but once a general understanding of cathodes (positive) and anodes
    (negative) is acquired, it becomes much simpler. Be mindful that the longer
    leg of each LED is the positive node, and the shorter is the negative.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step One: Soldering the LEDs</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Each LED will need to be soldered to provide enough length to connect to
    the Arduino board. To do so, solder each leg of the LED to the desired
    length of copper wire. Repeat this process for each LED.
</p>
<p><img src="img/02-smith.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 2. Soldering.</p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Two: Readying the Breadboard</strong>
</p>
<p>
To begin, take one wire from the wire bundle and connect it to the (–) slot on the breadboard. Take the other end and connect
    it to the <strong>GND</strong> input on the digital side of the Arduino.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Three: Connecting the LEDs to the Breadboard, Arduino</strong>
</p>
<p>
Keeping in mind the cathode(<strong>+</strong>) and anode (–) of each LED, take the positive leg and insert the
    copper wire into <strong>Input 2</strong> on the Arduino board. Next, take
    the negative leg and insert it into the same (–) row on
    the breadboard as the <strong>GND</strong> wire.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note: </strong>If you are using an Arduino Uno, you will begin with    <strong>Input 3</strong>&mdash;the code may need to be slightly altered as well.
</p>
<p><img src="img/03-smith.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 3. Powering the LEDs.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Four: LED Test</strong>
</p>
<p>
    At this point, if you have uploaded the code to your Arduino, the LED
    should simply turn on when the wires are properly connected.
</p>
<p>
    If your LED does not turn on, ensure you have thoroughly followed the above
    steps. One common problem is having the <strong>GND</strong> wire from the
    breadboard accidently inserted into the analog input on the Arduino.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Five: Adding LEDs</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Continue adding LEDs. Subsequent LEDs will go in chronological order from 2, so
    the next LED’s cathode will go into <strong>Input 3</strong> and its anode
    will go into the same row as the other wires on the breadboard. Repeat this
    process until each LED’s leg has been inserted into the digital inputs of
    the Arduino and the (–) of the breadboard.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note: </strong>If you are using an Arduino Uno, you will be forced to stop at    <strong>Input 11</strong>, as it is the last digital input. If you are
    using the Mega 2560, you may go to pens 44, 45, and 46.
</p>
<p><img src="img/04-smith.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 4. Powering multiple LEDs.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Six: LED Test</strong>
</p>
<p>
    At this point, all 11 LEDs should be connected to the Arduino and
    breadboard. Ensure each LED works before continuing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Physical Installation Directions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This portion of the instruction set will explain the assembling of the
    physical components to this project.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step One: Container Construction and Conductive Paint</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Take one clear container, discard the lid, and turn it upside down. Then,
    take one circle of construction paper, glue one side, and place it on the
    middle of the container. Press and hold tightly to ensure it stays. Next,
    take (approximately) 8in. of copper tape and run it from the center of the
    circle and down the back of the container. A small strip of copper tape
    should hang off the back.
</p>
<p>
    Take the Bare Conductive paint pen and add a dab of it to the construction
    paper (note: a little bit goes a long way). Using a paint brush (I found my
    fingers worked best), spread the paint to cover the entire surface of the
    paper, including the copper tape. This ensures an electrical current can
    run from the circle to the copper tape. Repeat this process until each
    container’s circle/copper tape is overlaid with conductive paint.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note: </strong>Overlaying the copper tape with electric paint is not necessary but does
    ensure slightly better electrical flow.

<p id="figure">Figure 5. Capacitive Touch Container.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Two: Adding the Bare Conductive Touch Board</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Take a pair of alligator clips and attach one end to the Bare Conductive
    Touch Board and the other to the copper tape on the container. Be mindful
    of which sound input you want to be connected to each container. For
    example, E0 on the Touch Board will likely be connected to the first
    container. Repeat this process for each container.
</p>
<p><img src="img/06-smith.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 6. Touch Board and Containers.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note: </strong>Because there are so many alligator clips and wires involved, it is
    difficult to make what lies behind the containers aesthetically pleasing.
    Increasing the amount of tape used to add length to the project may help.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Three: Adding the LEDs</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Reconnect the LEDs to Arduino inputs 5-13, and 44, 45, and 46 (if you have
    a Mega 2560). At this point, the LEDs should be connected to both the
    Arduino and the (–) input on the breadboard. Manipulate
    the wires as necessary and place them inside each container.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note: </strong>
    I soldered a small hole in the back of each container to hold the lights
    and help with light distribution.
</p>
<p><img src="img/07-smith.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 7. Soldered holes for LED.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Four: Testing “Musical Vitality”</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Plug in your Arduino and Bare Conductive Touch Board to the desired power
    source. Next, take an auxiliary cable and plug into the speaker jack of the
    Touch Board and into a speaker.
</p>
<p>
    With everything properly connected, by touching any of the “buttons” on the
    container, a song should play through the speaker while the LEDs fade in
    and out at different times. Congratulations, you now have your own working
    touch, sound, and sight installation!
</p>
<p><img src="img/08-smith.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 8. The final installation.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note: </strong>
    In the final installation, song lyrics printed on transparent paper were
    glued to the front of each container so that the audience could not see
    wiring inside of the containers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Instruction Set Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>
    My hope is that the goal of this instruction set is clear enough that a
    user may create their own musical installation, whether that may be a
    direct replication of “Musical Vitality” or by altering the code for their
    own, unique projects. That said, the following section, “Delivering”
    “Musical Vitality” more fully illuminates how rhetorical delivery could be
    used in the production of a critical making project.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> “Delivering” “Musical Vitality”</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As noted in the Instruction Set of this chapter, the first portion of the
    project was working through the Processing language in order to manipulate
    the LEDs to “flow” with the music that we had selected. The code itself was
    relatively simple—each LED was coded to a particular input on the Arduino
    and each was set to match the time signature of the selected song; for
    example, for one song, Roy Orbison’s “Pretty Woman,” which is a relatively
    fast-paced song written in 4/4 signature, the LED was set to fade in and
    out at 14.5 milliseconds. This process was repeated a total of 10 times—one
    for each song chosen.
</p>
<p>
    Like many of us in the humanities, I found my inability to properly code
    (that is, using common practices like “loops” or properly understanding how
    the “plane” worked) somewhat troublesome. Although Processing itself is
    meant for beginners, it still is a powerful language with a proper
    understanding of certain mathematic principles like trigonometry.
    Nonetheless, Morey’s call to situate delivery “within current writing
    technologies” allowed me to think through writing a piece of code that
    would manifest itself into the world and act “rhetorically” through a
    physical computing project—in this case, the blinking LED bulbs (8). The
    LEDs themselves were designed to create the “affective attunement with the
    audience” that Morey mentions and draw the audience in to ultimately engage with
    the product itself—a rhizomatic structure, if you will (or at least one
    insertion point that invites a participant to engage with the exhibition),
    and one that would provide one avenue for a rhetorical transmission to
    occur (216). The act of coding itself, regardless of the level at which I
    could write, allowed me to think beyond common writing practices to examine
    how coding could lead me to create a critically made project that could
    draw an audience in.
</p>
<p>
    As I worked through the LED apparatus of the project, I began to consider
    the ways in which we, as critical makers, often find ourselves using
    digital technologies that allow for the insertion of ourselves into a
    medium, whether it be through voice, touch, motion tracking, etc. Like the
    other facets of this project, the inspiration for this thought came from a
    close reading of Morey’s work, specifically chapter 6, titled “Posthuman
    Gestures and Electrate Attunements.” Without delving too far into the
    theoretical aspects of this chapter, Morey essentially makes the case for
    how our bodies have become <em>posthuman</em> because of the ways they are
    augmented by technologies that allow us to easily network, or connect, with
    other bodies&mdash;e.g., a cellphone and how we utilize it as a gateway to other
    networks, whether it be through texting, social media, forums, etc. If it
    is the posthuman body that “performs the operations of delivery on behalf
    of the deliverer,” then physical computing objects, such as the Arduino and
    capacitive touch shield, can play a significant role in this process by
    allowing the performer to insert themselves into the medium (216). By
    asking audience members to engage with “Musical Vitality” via “inserting
    themselves” into the installation, I was attempting to put Morey’s ideas of
    the posthuman into practice by creating an “affective attunement with the
    audience,” notably through a haptic experience with sound (216).
</p>
<p>
    In order to explore how a member of the audience could insert themselves
    into “Musical Vitality,” 11 clear containers were equipped with Bare
    Conductive paint, a piece of copper tape, and then connected to the Bare
    Conductive Touch Board. LEDs were connected to the Arduino Mega, which
    acted as the on/off switch. The initial idea behind this was that by
    touching the containers and turning on the music, one would essentially
    provide a <em>pulse</em> to the flickering LEDs. What I came to realize,
however, through the theoretical groundings of Morey’s <em>Rhetorical Delivery and Digital Technologies</em>, was that the
    installation itself was a reflection of how we become posthuman via digital
    technologies that allow us to insert ourselves into the medium at hand.
    Simply by touching the container, members of the audience extended
    themselves into the media of both the Arduino and the Bare Conductive Touch
    Board, and this resulted in the affective attunement with others that were
    near the project. The actions of those engaging with the project not only
    acted as a switch within these technologies to fulfill the commands of the
    Touch Board, but they also re-projected our actions into the world—in this
    case, through the playing of music. As a member of the audience views the
    project, they too become part of this <em>everted</em> reality that
    operates within the digital and analog world.
</p>
<p>
    Sean Morey was not the only rhetorical scholar used in this production,
    though he undoubtedly provided the bulk of the inspiration. Both Robert J.
    Connors and Collin Gifford Brooke offered elements of rhetorical delivery
    that were used in the production of this installation. For example, keeping
    the conventions presented by Connors in mind (type/typefaces,
    typography/layout) a specific font (Ariel Black) and size (which varied to
    break up monotony) was chosen for the containers that was legible and
    appropriate for the installation. Brooke, on the other hand, allowed me to
    think through the ways that the transmission of information (in this case,
    the music) could occur between bodies (participants) and media (the
    installation) and how there were certain design principles that could be
    followed to bolster <em>ethos</em> (such as choosing a font that could be
    read by a wide audience).
</p>
<p>
    “Musical Vitality” was, during its inception, designed with the traditional
    notion of rhetoric in mind—that is, how, or in what ways, could a
    rhetorically persuasive project be made? I soon came to realize through
    scholars of digital delivery such as Robert J. Connors, Collin Gifford
    Brooke, and Sean Morey that I could create an everted reality project,
    which would allow users to reciprocally migrate between the digital and
    analog world. This extension began with the code (in the delivery terms of
    Sean Morey, a more computational method of writing) written in Processing
    that was uploaded to the Arduino, which fed power to the LEDs inside of the
    containers, thus serving as an insertion point for the greater rhizomatic
    structure that was the project itself; from the Bare Conductive Touch Board
    to the capacitive touch sensors on the containers, which allowed the
    audience to insert themselves into the medium; and from the containers
    themselves to a member of the audience interacting with it, until,
    ultimately, a feedback loop was created, allowing for the affective
    attunement that Morey theorizes about in the latter half of his work.
    Although I am unsure of whether this is a common approach to critical
    making, I believe that using rhetorical scholarship can help guide us, as
    “makers,” to create engaging projects through various technologies and, in
    turn, allow us to hold true to critical making’s purpose: “to supplement
    and extend critical reflection and, in doing so, to reconnect our lived
    experiences with technologies to social and conceptual critique” (Ratto
    253).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Conclusion, Reflection, and Future Studies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Throughout this research, I have proposed the idea of using the conventions
    of rhetorical delivery to craft an engaging, critically made project. The
    inclusion of Robert J. Connors “<em>Actio</em>: A Rhetoric of Manuscripts,”
Collin Gifford Brooke’s <em>Lingua Fracta</em>, and Sean Morey’s <em>Rhetorical Delivery and Digital Technologies</em> provided the
    theoretical framework for which I could explore how digital technologies,
    such as Processing and the Arduino (though certainly not limited to these)
    could be used to create a persuasive, critically-made project. Various
    concepts from each author aided in the construction of “Musical Vitality,”
    such as Morey’s notions of digital writing technologies which allowed me to
    write a piece of code that was capable of being rhetorically persuasive
    when uploaded to the Arduino; the LEDs and their ability to draw members of
    the audience in; and the capacitive touch containers that allowed a user to
    insert themselves into the medium via pressing a hand-crafted “button.”
    Connors’ call to keep in mind the aesthetics when <em>delivering</em> a
document also went hand-in-hand with Brooke’s desire to bolster <em>ethos</em> through proper decision making. Perhaps, then, scholars
    should begin to consider the ways that other rhetorical canons, such as
    style or memory, could be formulated into critical making projects.
</p>
<p>
    “Musical Vitality” was met with positive reviews, notably how simple it was
    to interact with, and the inclusion of the flickering LEDs that served as an
    attention-trap. In hindsight, there are a few aspects of the project I
    would change: rather than simply using music, I think that exploring a more
    haptic approach would be more engaging for interactors. For example, each
    container could be bound to a specific musical instrument, and by touching
    each container a user is able to create their own musical score. This type
of project would be reflective of popular games such as <em>Guitar Hero</em> or <em>Donkey Konga</em>, wherein a user plays a
    rhythmic game via a special controller. Additionally, I would like to add a
    qualitative component to this research, perhaps in the form of
    microethnographies, wherein I film users engaging with this project to
    explore how the body adapts to using capacitive touch technologies with a
    goal of being rhetorically persuasive.
</p>
<p>
    Future studies on critical making could also continue to explore the ways
    in which physical computing/critical making projects may allow us, or our
    students, to learn the conventions of a subject, as was done in the course
    I shadowed called “Digital Rhetoric (and Writing) with Arduino and
    Processing.” Other projects could also expand beyond the Arduino and seek
    to explore Raspberry Pi, which can run multiple programs, whereas the
    Arduino Uno can only run one; another may be through something as simple as
    the creation of an interactive floormat, as was done by Jessica Handloff,
    Geoffrey Luurs, and Sarah Beth Evans in their project “The Ambient Sole: A
    Digital Engagement Project.” In the future, I hope to explore the Microsoft
    Kinect through a program called TouchDesigner and, using theories of affect
    and atmospheres, create a project capable of exploring spatiality and how
    the body changes in certain spatial contexts. That being said, the Arduino
    and Processing are exceptional tools for learning not only the conventions
    of coding and physical computing but also exploring avenues for blending
    rhetorical scholarship and critical making together, which I hope this
    piece will inspire others to do.

<p><strong>Notes</p></strong>
<p>1. There are some advantages and disadvantages to purchasing an Arduino Uno over the Mega 2560. For starters, Adafruit no longer sells the Mega 2560, so it may be more difficult to find, and the Uno has an option for a bundle. The Mega 2560 is a bigger board and has far more digital inputs with power-width modulation (PWM) capabilities. In simpler terms, using a Mega 2560 allows the users to have more LEDs and more control over what the LEDs do in their installation.</p>
