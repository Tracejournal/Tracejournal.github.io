<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
    LabSynthE is a creative arts laboratory investigating synthetic and
    electronic poetry in the School of Arts, Technology, and Emerging
    Communication (ATEC) at The University of Texas at Dallas. We are more of a
    studio and co-laboratory than a laboratory, however we call ourselves a
    “lab” to conform to language used in other spaces of sanctified
    collaboration, where art and scientific, computational, robotic and
    otherwise hybrid practices take on a “laboratory” format to express their
    experimentation. LabSynthE provides a framework for collaboration among
    faculty and students for creative practice, thinking, and exhibition, which
    take many forms. We have presented a DADA concert on the iconic ATEC
    stairway, a performance night at the Dallas Museum of Art, a formal art
    exhibition in CentralTrak (a Dallas gallery), an interactive sculpture to
    commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day, a tour of exit signs in various
    galleries and academic exhibitions, as well as the project we detail in
    this essay. During the past two years we have collaborated with faculty
    from the school of ATEC as well as the School of Arts and Humanities, and
    students ranging from undergraduate arts students to MA, MFA, and PhD
    students.
</p>
<p><strong>LabSynthE’s History</strong></p>
<p>
    The lab began in spring 2016 when the School was in its infancy, under the
    guidance of an interim Dean. Dr. Frank Dufour posted a sign on the door of
    a sound recording room, “LabSynthE: 12-2 on Tuesdays.” Professor xtine
    burrough joined the School and the lab in the same year, without knowing
    what she was stepping into, and found Dr. Dufour’s methodologies and
    interests parallel to her own, so she committed to staying with the lab as
    a co-organizer. During their first year and a half, the lab consisted of
    Dufour and burrough with approximately eight regular attendees at weekly
    two-hour meetings. They produced three exhibitions (one on campus for
    Holocaust Remembrance Day and two at sites off campus) and a sound
    recording that became the only U.S. work selected as a finalist in the 2017 <em>HearSay</em> international audio competition. The lab typically operates
    as follows: someone suggests an event or festival for which we could create
    a piece or a proposal; the team meets to think, discuss, and research; we
    decide on a conceptual direction, produce materials and present work in
    diverse spaces. Sometimes we write collaboratively about our work and
    process. Many times, projects take on multiple iterations (like our
    projects <em>Radium Girls</em> by the co-authors of this paper and <em>Lion’s Breath</em> co-produced by the lab) and influence new works, as
    we get inspired in our research and discussions. At times, a member may
    have an idea for a project they are developing, or some path they are
    intrigued to investigate, and the whole lab gets involved, providing
    feedback, participating in experimental discovery, discussing and revising
    one member’s work, which at times becomes the work of the lab as a
    collective. For instance, Letícia Ferreira’s poetry projects of spring 2017
    became a focal point of experimentation for many lab members, which then
    inspired how <em>The Radium Girls</em> was exhibited in a sound art exhibit
    around the same time.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Dufour’s background in sound recording and professor burrough’s
    experience in participatory art and installation inform many of the
    practices of the lab. Conceptually, Dr. Dufour’s interest in phenomenology
    and professor burrough’s interest in remix studies and appropriation spark
    dialog between projects that ignite ideas, both abstract and concrete, that
    lab members reflect on for continuous conversations at lab meetings and on
    our Slack channel. While LabSynthE does not consider itself a space for
    Matt Ratto’s notion of “critical making,” we align with Garnet Hertz’s
    collaborative, DIY approach and foster a “crash course in understanding how
    something actually works” by making projects together. To date, memory,
    translation, and poetics are recurrent themes in the projects developed by
    LabSynthE collaborators. People who were part of the lab and collaborated
    in the project explored in this paper with burrough and Dr. Dufour are
    Delaney Conroy (BA), Ritwik Kaikini (MA), Morgan Grasham (MFA), Clayton
    Harper (MFA), Letícia Ferreira (PhD), Sean Landers (PhD), and professors
    Dr. Heidi Coley and Dr. Sabrina Starnaman. Many of these contributors
    participated in different moments of the project from conception to
    production.
</p>
<p><strong>Contested Spaces and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>
    Since we developed unconventionally, without sanction from the School, we
    were not provided a meeting room or budget. During the first year and a
    half we saw no reason to ask for a room—we met in the sound recording room,
    familiar to Dr. Dufour and his regular students. However, in fall 2017 Dr.
    Dufour went on leave, and with professor burrough (who does not teach
    sound) organizing the group we lost privilege to the sound recording room.
    We became nomadic, checking out rooms or working in other labs where group
    members held affiliations.
</p>
<p>
    As a group of artists, LabSynthE is always interested in finding places for
    exhibition. We have tested projects on campus and taken them to academic
    conferences and media arts exhibits, and we have been able to work together
    to produce a group exhibition of related works, but one challenge we often
    face is finding new places to exhibit a work of art that the lab can
    produce together. When ATEC’s new Dean, Anne Balsamo, brought her Public
    Interactive Research Lab (PIRL) and ongoing AIDS Quilt Touch Project to the
    School, she also initiated a version of HIV/AIDS Week. In 2017 that event
    included opportunities for creative responses.
</p>
<p><strong>The AIDS Memorial Quilt and The Reading of Names</strong></p>
<p>
    The AIDS Memorial Quilt is the largest ongoing art community project in the
    world. In the 1980s, during the peak of the AIDS crisis, San Francisco
    activists created two by three foot panels on which they would write the
    names of loved ones who died of HIV/AIDS complications. These panels were
    sewn in groups of eight, creating a twelve by twelve-foot block. In 1987
    the NAMES Foundation was created to care for the Quilt and manage its
    growth, a role it still plays today. The Quilt was displayed in the
    Washington DC Mall six times; more than a collaborative piece of art, it is
    an important tool of political action that calls attention and pressures
    government and other stakeholders to look for solutions to the AIDS crisis.
    It is part of the tradition of the AIDS Quilt to read names of the people
    commemorated by it during the day(s) of its display. This is normally
    performed on a stage, with a microphone.
</p>
<p>
    Since 2002, Anne Balsamo and Dale MacDonald have worked to create the AIDS
    Quilt Touch (AQT), a project which aims to digitally preserve and augment
    the AIDS Memorial Quilt. Since then, many different institutions and
    researchers have collaborated in different iterations of the project. In
    2010, Dr. Balsamo and her team were awarded a Digital Humanities
    Implementation Grant by the National Endowment for the Humanities. The
    Public Interactives Research Lab (PIRL), led by Dean Balsamo and Associate
    Dean MacDonald, is one of the partners in the last iteration of the AQT
    project. As part of its commitment to HIV/AIDS activism and social justice,
    the lab annually organizes the UT Dallas HIV/AIDS Awareness Week, in
    partnership with other institutions of the University and the School. The
    events include displays of blocks of the AIDS Quilt, free HIV testing,
    talks and reading of names from the Quilt uninterruptedly for a day during
    International AIDS Day (December first).
</p>
<p>
    In 2017, labs and communities in ATEC were invited to create works of art
    or installations as part of the HIV/AIDS Week programming. Having Ferreira
    play a double role, both as the executive producer of AIDS Week and a
    regular member of LabSynthE, certainly elevated the potential interest
    level; however, we believe LabSynthE will continue to hold interest in this
    invitation. It is an opportunity to create a work of art open to a generous
    amount of traffic and interaction, the theme is coherent with the lab’s
    progressive ideas, and the AIDS Memorial Quilt involves community, memory
    and ritual, all research interests of the lab. As a conceptual, poetic, and
    practical opportunity, it offers a rich form for participation: every year
    we can choose to iterate on the same piece or explore other possibilities
    within a similar environment. For the HIV/AIDS Week of 2017, LabSynthE
    focused on the action of reading the names but shifted the nature of the
    interaction—what is usually public, loud, and witnessed—became an intimate
    and poetic participatory installation.
</p>
<p><strong>Conceptual Threads</strong></p>
<p>
    Before we started making we had several meetings in which our production
    was in the realm of dialog. We produced ideas. Having read names aloud
    during the prior year’s event, professor burrough remembered how it felt to
    stand on stage and what it was like to look at the students who congregated
    in this public space—some attentive, some eating a snack, some talking to
    friends— and how moving it was at the end to add the names of people she
    knew and people she wanted to remember. These experiences informed the
    first broad brush stroke that would paint a portrait of the audio quilt we
    would create in just under eight weeks. The first pitch for the project was
    for an interactive card that we would hand to passersby in the ATEC lobby
    with an invitation to record themselves reading names. Our participants
    would print any additional names inside the cards, mirroring the reading of
    the names that happens when the AIDS Memorial Quilt is displayed. burrough
    suggested minimal, white cards, with a red thread keeping the card sewn
    shut, and no other visual designs on the card other than the recording
    device and hand-written names. We imagined that for our version of the
    reading and recording to be gentle, it would require a LabSynthE member to
    interact with each participant by giving her a card and some amount of
    instruction. We envisioned taking people under the stairwell in the lobby
    where students meet or rest between classes to record their readings, then
    hanging the cards in installments of twenty each day for the duration of
    AIDS Week. Junichi Murata writes about the ambiguity of technological
    artifacts—including DIY products, “One of the important and most general
    reasons we create technologies is to free ourselves from various types of
    work. However, if we examine this aspect of technology more closely its
    ambiguous character becomes apparent” (153). The DIY recording device freed
    LabSynthE from the work of hosting or staging the reading of the names, and
    instead relocated this public activity inside another ambiguous artifact,
    one that is, like the squares of the quilt, crafted by hand. Murata
    characterizes “technological artifacts as co-actors;” and during this
    installation we imagine ourselves as the hosts, the guests we give each
    card to as the invited reader, the cards as the keepers of the names, both
    written and recorded—and later played (154). In this sense, there are
    multiple co-actors on the scene. Beginning with the humans: There are
    members of LabSynthE; people walking through the ATEC lobby who agreed (and
    some who did not agree) to take a card and record a list of ten or more
    names; and people wandering or stalling in the ATEC lobby who played the
    cards. The non-human co-actors, if we call all technological artifacts
    co-actors, must include not just the DIY recorders but also the cards
    themselves, with the hand-written list of names and needlework.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most interesting conversations we had was a negotiation of
    whether we should use DIY technology for the sound recorder inside the
    handmade card or create the recording devices ourselves. Weighing the price
    per unit, time for delivery and production, the size of our team (nine
    collaborators in total), and time until HIV/AIDS Week (date of our
    installation), we had to use a readily available DIY technology.
    Pedagogically, we found merit with Hertz’s claim that the “process of being
    humiliated by things that you think are easy or mindless is a valuable
    experience.” In one conversation we wondered if we could call ourselves
    “artists” if we did not make the things we produced. Ultimately, we are
    artists who appropriate, hack, and reimagine how the DIY recording device
    is designed for interaction. Unlike Ratto’s claims for critical making, in
    which the prototype materializes critical thinking “to extend knowledge and
    skills in relevant technical areas as well as to provide the means for
    conceptual exploration,” our platform was made for public interaction, as a
    space for participants to explore (253). Our critical reflection happens
    during the conceptualization and brainstorming phase, and in the
    interactions between the work of art, the space and public participants
    (253). Ratto states that “the final prototypes are not intended to be
    displayed and to speak for themselves” (253). Displaying, observing, and
    learning from the interventions a work provokes is an essential part of
    LabSynthE’s iterative practice.
</p>
<p>
    By the end of the production period, we spent more than twenty hours
    creating the hand-made cards, with a rotating three to four team members
    collaborating on an assembly line that would make Ford proud. We arrived at
    using a “DIY 1 Push” recording device specifically made for cards available
    from Big Dawgs, priced at a discount in our bulk order. This year the Dean
    allotted an endowment to professor burrough that she was able to share with
    the lab, so funding for this project was readily available. In the future,
    the lab will need to find a sustainable source of funding. It has become
    obvious in the two and growing years that LabSynthE requires its own space
    and funding.
</p>
<p><strong>Chain Piecing: Learning by Doing</strong></p>
<p>
    As soon as we received our first Big Dawgs recording device we were able to
    create an alpha version of the handmade card. A Visiting Associate
    Professor who joined us on this project, Dr. Heidi Cooley, suggested we sew
    the recording device into the card. Embedding the technology of the quilt
    into the card was an aesthetic and structural suggestion that was in
    conceptual alignment with the primitive idea for the card. Like the AIDS
    Quilt Touch project, it uses technology to expand the traditions and
    rituals of the AIDS Memorial Quilt. The reading of names is an ephemeral
    performance. Our project allows for the ritual of remembering a person by
    saying their name to be recreated every time one presses a button,
    therefore expanding the performance to one that is intimately mediated
    through technology. Like the public reading of names, our Audio Quilt is
    also ephemeral by the chance that the battery dies or the installation
    participant/viewers re-record on top of recorded names.
</p>
<p>
    Nine of us met to start a production line two weeks before AIDS Week
    (burrough, Conroy, Cooley, Ferreira, Grasham, Harper, Kaikini, Landers, and
    Starnaman). We had most of the project conceptually worked out but realized
    that the recording device did not have holes or a space where we would
    easily be able to sew it into the card. burrough pushed the needle through
    the fleshy part of the speaker to secure it to the paper and Dr. Cooley
    sewed a bow on the back of it; Ferreira sewed down the cable wires; Kaikini
    realized we should replace the piece that covers the battery so it would
    not run out before our installation began. Within the first hour of
    collaborating on the design of the card, the team experienced what Gilbert
    Simondon would refer to as an aesthetic sensation, which stayed with us
    throughout our assembly line process (see figure 1). Simondon writes,
    “Aesthetics is not only, nor first and foremost, the sensation of the
    ‘consumer’ of the work of art. It is also, and more originally so, the set
    of sensations, more or less rich, of the artists themselves: it’s about a
    certain contact with matter that is being transformed through work. One
    experiences something aesthetic when one is doing a soldering or driving in
    a long screw” (3). Some of us talked about the aesthetic experience while
    we were making the cards. Conroy and burrough shared that they were both
    silent and “in the zone,” the work transforming them into a meditative
    state, while others were talking about television shows, movies, and the
    upcoming holiday. We also talked about how coming together to make the
    piece resembled how panels of the AIDS Memorial Quilt were made:
    collectively, in workshops at community centers.

<p id="figure">Figure 1. LabSynthE members collaborating on the production of <em>An Audio Quilt of A Thousand Names</em>.</p>
<p>
    Then we realized our most productive roles: burrough is slowest at
    threading needles and fastest at cutting and folding paper; Ferreira,
    Cooley, and Starnaman can work the needle and thread quickly; Kaikini took
    each recording device from the box, tested it, and replaced the paper near
    the battery with a red ribbon; Grasham wrote many names. Kaikini and Conroy
    met again to cut and fold cards, and insert recording devices on a separate
    working day, prepping the lab for sewing before the Fall holiday. Harper
    and Landers helped to sew in various parts of the production line, as we
    met at different times during the two weeks prior to our installation.
    Thus, the team worked together to produce their version of the quilt of one
    thousand names.
</p>
<p><strong>Twenty Cards a Day for Five Days</strong></p>
<p>
    AIDS Week took place from Monday, November 27 – Friday, December 1, 2017.
    During each day at noon we set twenty of our cards on the table next to the
    display of a block of the AIDS Memorial Quilt (see figure 2).
</p>
<p><img src="img/02-burrough.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 2. Cards presented on the table near the AIDS Memorial Quilt where passersby chose one at random to untie and record their reading of the names. Cards were collected at the end of the day and hung by a LabSynthE member in the growing installation throughout the week.</p>
<p>
    When we invited passersby to participate in the project, we knew we would
    have to provide instructions for participating in our project. What we did
    not predict was how it was almost always necessary to discuss the history
    of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the reading of the names tradition and the
    importance of the HIV/AIDS Awareness Week event. At times, the display of
    blocks of the AIDS Quilt, the outreach and awareness campaign happening on
    a table next to it and the Audio Quilt became different layers of the same
    performance/project, as we shared space, time, and team members. Young
    students, who were often puzzled by the AIDS Quilt display and needed time
    to understand its historical context, would frequently be excited to
    participate and record names on the cards. We suggested participants record
    their reading under the stairs, which became the “official” site of
    private, intimate performances of remembrance.
</p>
<p><img src="img/03-burrough.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 3. On Monday we installed the cards beneath a stairwell on the east side of the ATEC building.</p>
<p><img src="img/04-burrough.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 4. On Tuesday we installed the cards under the stairs on the west side of the building.</p>
<p><img src="img/05-burrough.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 5. Wednesday through Friday we installed the cards hanging together, over a central space of study and passage.</p>
<p>
    We hung the cards at the end of each day in different parts of the building
    (see figures 3, 4 and 5), so they would slowly occupy more of ATEC’s
    uncontested lobby space as the week passed. Because we did not want to
    permanently alter the recording devices, we tucked the recording button and
    cables into the board and attached a “Play” label near its button before
    hanging each card (see figure 6). Even so, some people pressed the
    record button—accidentally or not—while trying to play the installation,
    and would therefore erase the previous recording. This was a risk of the
    project. However, we embraced this as a valid possibility of interaction by
    the people who pass through the ATEC building. Just as the messy artifacts
    of humanity occur in the listing of the names, and people fumble in the
    live readings, we account for these types of unexpected human interactions
    as part of our creative inquiry in the public installation of this paper
    version of the <em>Audio Quilt of One Thousand Names</em>. We expected to
    de-install our interactive sculpture on December 1st, but the facilities
    team suggested it remain active in the space. The audio quilt hung until
    late February when facilities needed the lobby cleared for an event.

<p><strong>Iterative Practices</strong></p>
<p>
    The team was great at coming together to cut, fold, stitch, and create.
    During AIDS Week we knew we needed help, but we forgot to ask for it prior
    to the week of the event. Throughout the week—and it was a busy week near
    the end of the semester, a tough time to ask people at school for extra
    help—we could have used more voices and hands to explains the project to
    passersby and hang the installation. Murilo Paiva Homsi is an affiliated
    member of LabSynthE who was greatly involved in assisting us with the
    installation of this project each night during the week. In retrospect, one
    thing that would have been helpful was to create a sign-up sheet for this
    performative labor. When the cards were set on the table for public
    interaction, they were not yet a finished work of art. Instead, they were a
    call for participation that held a potential for creative interaction. They
    only became objects of art that “speak for themselves” after they were
    finished by the participants who interacted with them and were hung
    together in a cluster. To engage an audience with such an intimate project,
    the artist or someone on the artist’s behalf must talk with the person who
    becomes a collaborator in the project (or a voice for our quilt). Help
    comes in various forms, however, and it is important to embrace the
    creative ways that people provide their assistance. Kaikini made a
    documentary of the <em>Audio Quilt of One Thousand Names</em> for our
    archives and social media (see figure 7), which showcased the cards hanging

<p id="figure">Figure 7. Documentary video by Ritwik Kaikini of An Audio Quilt of One Thousand Names, by LabSynthE. Edith O’Donnell Arts and Technology Building at The University of Texas at Dallas, November 27-December 1, 2017.</p>
<p>
    We found that most people pressed the “Play” button, as we expected. We
    also noticed many people who pressed one, and then two, and then multiple
    play buttons to hear a choir of names read at sites of installation as seen
    in Kaikini’s documentation. The proximity of the cards to one another, and
    their location—in the lobby at easy-to-reach heights—set the stage for a
    relatively easy interaction. We spent a lot of time pressing the play
    buttons in this highly public space, so we could have been influencers.
    Once someone sees one person interacting with the work, the aura of the art
    is altered. Not surprisingly, by the end of the week, some of the cards
    played a static hum. This was a result of the “Record” button having been
    pressed instead of the “Play” button, despite the clarity of the labeling
    system we put in place.
</p>
<p>
    The devices came with a recording wire labeled with a yellow sticker and
    the letters, “REC.” However, the play button was unlabeled. We added our
    own, slightly larger and more legible (and printed by hand, to create
    aesthetic unity with the cards), “Play” labels to encourage viewers to
    interact with the installation. The white cards and red thread from which
    they were hanging were designed so minimally that these labels provided a
    contrast in hue and shifted the visual weight of a counterbalance on the
    horizontal axis in relationship to the cards that were suspended from
    above. In a next iteration of the project we will discuss removing the
    record button from the wire after the names have been recorded. Questions
    to inform future iterations would include: If only the play button is
    available, are we suggesting that the one reading of the names listed on
    the card is final? With the record button in place (as it was this time),
    we offer the possibility for multiple versions of the reading of the list
    of names. The cards can be removed, re-stitched together, taken to a new
    site, and re-recorded. Like the plurality of voices during the reading of
    the names on December 1st, with the recording button intact, we keep the
    card open to this same possibility.

<p><strong>Contested/Uncontested: The past, present, and future of LabSynthE</strong></p>
<p>
    While LabSynthE began as an unofficial lab, it has offered a highly
    productive creative practice for faculty and graduate students in and
    affiliated with the School. As a result of the amount of production,
    quality of the work, and places where the work has been showcased, the lab
    is likely to soon fall outside of the contested domain and enter a more
    official role in campus community. Sometimes our practices touch on
    uncontested areas, like the professionalization of graduate education, for
    instance, reminding graduate students to submit works to new media
    festivals when deadlines approach. Other times, our operations also border
    on contested zones of operation, like when the Communications Department
    followed us to three different labs in an hour because we do not have a
    dedicated room and we had to find the best lighting conditions in an
    available room during the week before fall break for their photographers.
    In many ways LabSynthE is like our audio quilt. It is synthetically pieced
    together, everyone plays a part, we are learning who we are through shared,
    creative practice, and we are iterative.
</p>
<p>
    We look forward to how future iterations of our practice will develop as we
    become more official in the School. We operate under many constraints
    including time, space, and funding, and our process has always been
    connected to these conditions. For now, we are awaiting a new space, which
    will be helpful not only for meetings and production but also for
    storage—we have amassed one hundred cards, five bird cages, a retro “Bar
    Aid” recipe holder, Raspberry Pis, soldering irons, straws, a handmade
    “black box,” a paper cutter, leftover paper, sewing materials, and of
    course online repositories for code, videos, photos, and essays. Parts of
    projects are skewed in various labs and offices throughout the School. The
    University granted us a website on the labs.utdallas domain, which will
    appear more authentic to outsiders than our prior URL, which was stored on
    a second-level folder of burrough’s portfolio website. We do not yet know
    if we will be guaranteed funding, but we continue to work with the
    materials we have and to generate projects and proposals for public
    audiences.
