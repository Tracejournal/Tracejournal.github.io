<h2><strong>New Materialism and the Intimacy of Post-digital Handwriting</strong></h2>
<h3>Adam Wickberg</h3>

    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        New Materialism and the Intimacy of Post-digital Handwriting
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    After Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential elections in 2016, images of
    his signature quickly started circulating on social media. They were often
    accompanied by comments about the new president’s curious handwriting and
    what it might reflect. Suggestions of what Trump’s handwriting looked like
    included the sound wave of a screaming demon and the gates of Mordor.
    Perhaps social media users were just trying to make sense of the new
    political era in U.S. politics he inaugurated, but the fascination with
    handwritten text in digital milieus captures a phenomenon known as the
    post-digital condition.
</p>
<p>
    This essay analyzes three cases of the changing ontology and epistemic
    conditions of the practice of handwriting after digitization. It does so by
    developing a theory of post-digital handwriting, that is, writing on paper
    by hand which is then digitized as image and disseminated online. The
    theory draws on scholarship in media theory on the post-digital as well as
    insights from new materialism. The cases discussed are penmanship porn,
    bullet journaling, and the political signature, all phenomena which
    highlight the intimacy and singularity of handwriting as a physical and
    sensory practice reminiscent of the modern understanding of love letters.
    The peculiar phenomenon of “penmanship porn” can be found in online posting
    communities like Reddit, where users contribute and comment on examples of
    particularly beautiful handwriting. The notoriously slippery concept of
    “intimacy” is employed in this essay to describe the quality of emotional
    and physical nearness in the practice of handwriting, borrowing the
    definition from sociologist Anthony Giddens of intimacy as “a matter of
    emotional communication, with others and the self, in a context of
    interpersonal equality” (130). The relation of intimacy discussed here,
    however, is never direct but always an effect of the media practice and its
    trace as handwritten paper, whether it be one’s own writing or that of
    another. Furthermore, for the purpose of interrogating its coming into
    being, rather than presupposing two entities engaging in intimacy, I
    understand it to be the causal result of the intra-action of several
    entities. The concept of bullet journaling was created by digital
    product designer Ryder Caroll and is currently marketed to a younger
    generation as a combination of mindfulness and productivity system which
    uses handwriting as its method to navigate a post-digital life. This
    analysis shows how renewed interest in handwriting is produced through
    investment in physical affects like intimacy and closeness, which make them
    appear as singular when posted online. The same seem to apply for the
    interest in Donald Trump’s signature, which has been intensively circulated
    on Twitter and Instagram since he took office. Together, these examples
    reveal how, contrary to popular opinion in recent years, handwriting is not
    disappearing but rather transforming into a different practice, less tied
    to verbal communication and more employed as a visual phenomenon to
    invigorate the post-digital with the qualities of intimacy and singularity
    which it is sometimes said to be lacking. A number of books in the last
    decade has made the case of the imminent disappearance and death of
    handwriting (Trubek, Hensher, Burns Florey). A more nuanced account of the
    history of handwriting in relation to these changing conditions today is
    found in Sonja Neef’s work. In her view, handwriting has been challenged by
    technologies of imprint since the Gutenbergian revolution, yet it has
    always somehow survived. One might argue that the reach of digitization far
    exceeds those of previous shifts in writing technologies, but that would be
    overlooking the fact that technologies of writing and literacy have always
    been closely aligned. In Neef’s account, the question if handwriting will
    survive digitization is philosophically and historically incorrect (28).
    She notes that philosophically the question is erroneous because it assumes
    a teleological relationship between media and their practices. Written
    thirteen years ago, this position can today be validated by Apple’s launch and successful implementation of the “Apple pencil” for
    iPad. Understanding handwriting historically, she points out that “in spite
    of the emergence of generations of ‘writing machines’, manual script has
    never disappeared; on the contrary, as it evolved, handwriting adjusted its
    practical functions, social meanings and cultural aesthetics” (8). Zooming
    in on these changes of social meanings and cultural aesthetics, and
    specifically what I refer to as the changing ontology and epistemic
    conditions, this essay offers a mapping and analysis of what I call
    post-digital handwriting.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Post-digital media theory and New Materialism</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Florian Cramer, who is often cited as a pioneer of the concept, describes
    the post-digital as a phenomenon that takes place when digitization is so
    abundant and evident that it no longer seems to provoke wonder and optimism
    but is just as likely to cause resistance and distancing within the digital
    itself. He lists disenchantment of the digital and revival of old media as
    central features of the post-digital (13). Digital Humanities scholar David
    Berry argues along the same lines in insisting, “the historical distinction
    between the digital and the non-digital becomes increasingly blurred, to
    the extent that to talk about the digital presupposes an experiential
disjuncture that makes less and less sense.” (22) With the anthology <em>Post-digital Aesthetics</em>, Berry has further explored the phenomenon
    of post-digital within the fields of arts and design. Other media scholars
    like John Durham Peters have also insisted on the inseparability between
    the digital and the physical in the contemporary technological
    infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    These ideas are well supported by theoretical developments in New
    Materialism and Environmental Humanities. Geologist Peter Haff’s coining of
    the concept <em>technosphere</em> accounts for an “emerging global
    paradigm”— composed by a new spherical layer on the planet made up of “the
    interlinked set of communication, transportation, bureaucratic and other
    systems that act to metabolize fossil fuels and other energy resources”
    (301). Unlike the biosphere, atmosphere, and lithosphere, the technosphere
    has an autonomy in which an all-encompassing global society has become so
    dependent upon technology that people must service its parts continually in
    order to survive themselves. Simultaneously, important theoretical work has
    been done in New Materialism and Object Oriented Ontology to clear the
    ground for more nuanced understandings of digital culture. Karen Barad’s
    concept ethico-onto-epistemology highlights how the world is intra-actively
    co-constituted by humans and non-humans (90). The critical work in
    dissolving the binaries of nature and culture and that of body and mind can
productively be extended to the realm of the post-digital. Stacy Alaimo’s <em>transcorporeality</em> is another concept that is helpful in
    understanding the agency of material forces in and through human bodies
    (11). Iris Van de Tuin has discussed the shared critical genealogy of OOO
    and New Materialism but also notes crucial differences (233). Van der Tuin
    points out the tendency in some OOO work of replacing object with subject
    without actually changing more than semantics. Simultaneously, and on a
    related critical note, Timothy Morton has extended an Object Oriented
    Ontology that explores causality and strives to overcome binaries of
    natural and cultural. In <em>Realist Magic,</em> Morton argues “causality
    is wholly an <em>aesthetic</em> phenomenon. Aesthetic events are not
    limited to interactions between humans or between humans and painted
    canvases or between humans and sentences in dramas. They happen when a saw
bites into a fresh piece of plywood… <em>The aesthetic dimension is the causal dimension</em>” (19). Morton’s
    argument has a lot of bearing on the onto-epistemology of post-digital
    handwriting, in that it highlights singularity and contingency. The
    contemporary art scene has seen a proliferation of post-digital and
    post-internet artistic practices. This tendency, sometimes also referred to
    as the New Aesthetic, has developed in response to the same situation that
    scholars of the post-digital describe, namely that there no longer seems to
    exist a position outside of the digital and that hence a meaningful
    distinction of digital and not digital is increasingly difficult to uphold.
    I have explored the case of post-digital handwriting in the context of
    contemporary art elsewhere (Wickberg). Against this background, the term
    post-digital in this essay refers to the contemporary experience of a
    historical situation where what has been called the digital is now so
    abundant and far reaching that it affects aspects of being well beyond a
    keyboard and a screen. Post-digital handwriting then, is employed to
    describe the historical situation in which the epistemic conditions of
    writing by hand has changed from dialogical verbal communication to a
    visual object to be appreciated aesthetically and contribute singularity
    and intimacy to online communities.
</p>
<p>
    The case of post-digital handwriting can also be productively addressed
    drawing on insights from Karen Barad’s critical thought on materiality. In
    a radical rendering of Foucault, she repurposes the concept of apparatus in
    order to achieve a more nuanced understanding of the entanglement of
    meaning and matter: “Apparatuses are material (re)configurings/ discursive
    practices that produce material phenomena in their discursively
    differentiated becoming. A phenomenon is a dynamic relationality that is
    locally determinate in its matter and meaning as mutually determined
    (within a particular phenomenon) through specific causal intra-actions”
    (Barad 820). Causality again becomes important, and in the case of
    post-digital handwriting, it is the causal intra-action of words written on
    paper, digital camera technologies of smartphones, and immediate
    large-scale dissemination of social media and online communities which
    produces the <em>phenomenon</em>. Barad and Morton taken together offer a
    new materialist way of resolving the dualism of digital and analog, which
    is a core issue of post-digital media theory. In Barad’s agential realist
    account, discursive practices are specific material reconfigurations of the
    world in which meanings and properties are differentially enacted. This
    enables us to posit what has generally been understood as a verbal or
    semantic message, the written note, as a phenomenon shifting to a visual
    aesthetic dominance and producing effects like intimacy and closeness to
    human bodies through the intra-action with the human hand that stands in
    causal relation to it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The politics of post-digital handwriting</strong>
</p>
<p>
    One curious case of post-digital handwriting is the political signature. In
    it, the power of the hand still holds legal authority. It appears that in
    relation to the digital, this age-old performative act is rediscovered in
    online communities, perhaps because it is increasingly less an act carried
    out in the everyday. As Sonja Neef and José van Dijck puts it: “Signatures,
    for instance, were supposed to be authentic, idiosyncratic signs of selves,
    intimately tied to the hand that produced them; now that they are gradually
    replaced by memorized codes and biometrical scans, the former handwritten
    sign of identification is no longer considered foolproof” (2006). In a
    world of paper, the signature is commonplace and often understood as an
    extension of man in McLuhan’s sense, but as smart phone ID technology
    rapidly replaces the everyday legal signature, it becomes endowed with a
    type physical intimacy that can even be frightening.

<p id="figure">Figure 1. Donald Trump’s signature on Twitter after he took office in January 2017.</p>

<p>
    After Donald Trump won the presidential election, digital images of his
    signature were circulated and were interpreted, among other things, as the
    “gates of Mordor,” a “sound wave of demons,” and “a lie detector chart”
    (Voon). A week before taking office in January 2017, his counselor
    Kellyanne Conway tweeted the dreadful line “The pen is ready,” as a warning
    of what would come. After a few weeks the very pen that Conway tweeted
    about had already signed controversial bills of enormous geopolitical
    consequences. Arguably, Trump’s unorthodox political style as a President
    contributed to the attention his signature got. Typically, legislation
    changes and bills passed comprise a slow machinery, but in his case it
    appeared as though he was literally just signing papers he’d been asked to.
    In February 2017 the president signed a controversial legislation, undoing
    former president Obama’s regulation to protect waterways from coal mining
    waste that had just been finalized in December 2016. The first year of
    office alone saw the rollback of 70 environmental protection laws and
    rules. The rollbacks of Trump’s administration have meant that years of
    political work in a time of ecological emergency are undone, paper by
    paper, for each signed document. The impulsive acts that mark both his
    Twitter feed and his political legislature reflect a new political order,
    which also puts the handwritten signature in a different context, one that
    pairs well with the post-digital condition.
</p>
<p>
    In response to images of Trump signing terrifying bills and legislation
    encircled by a group of men in his office, as an almost theatrical staging
    of his political power, Swedish minister of environment Isabella Lövin
    posted a meme where she, encircled by only women, one of whom is pregnant,
    signs a power bill committing Sweden to climate change policy of net zero
    CO2 emissions by 2045. According to Lövin, the signing of that bill
    reflects an urge to assume a leading role globally in the fight against
    climate change. On the one hand, the mechanical act is almost trivial, on
    the other it can arguably have enormous consequences for humans and
    environments. I think this tension is part of what makes handwriting in
    digital milieus so attractive to users. Lövin has explained that her image
    was not staged but meant to reflect her everyday work as a politician and
    demonstrate to other politicians that quick action on climate is possible
    (Samuelson). She also comments on the fact that global political
    interactions, which were previously reserved for long diplomatic processes,
    are now held on Twitter. Political diplomacy is now so embedded in social
    media that the concept of “Twiplomacy” has been coined and given rise to
    studies of how world leaders deal with each other, and of course Trump, on
    Twitter. The social medium seems to open a dimension of everyday practice
    that used to be kept invisible to public perception. It also reflects the
    politics of post-digital handwriting in the seemingly banal signing of a
    bill, which through the instant and global dissemination of the
    reproduction of this very act seem to gain traction. Perhaps the
    materiality of handwriting also becomes more acute in an unpredictable
    political landscape&mdash;“will Trump pull out of the Paris Climate deal or
    not?”&mdash;and once the strokes of a pen on a particular piece of paper have
    happened such strokes highlight the political agency of the singular event,
    which is made visible through the digital reproduction of the event itself.
    Signing binding legislations and bills with dramatic consequences for
    global politics and posting a picture of it on Twitter summarizes the
    politics of post-digital handwriting.

    <strong>Penmanship Porn: Intimacy of Post-digital Handwriting</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Under headlines like “23 examples of penmanship porn that will sexually
    excite you,” Buzzfeed lists images of carefully crafted handwriting. On the
    online forum Reddit, there is a thread, a subreddit on penmanship porn
    which is filled with seemingly endless examples of handwritten notes. The
    community currently boasts no less than 500,000 members who receive updates
    on posts and contribute images of their own. Fonts and styles vary among
    the posts, but in many there prevails a strong sense of intimacy bordering
    on eroticism which, highlights the historical shift to post-digital
    handwriting. The qualities now associated with handwriting in the subreddit
    r/PenmanshipPorn are quite distant from the disciplinary exercise of
    handwriting lessons which dominated until the end of the 20<sup>th</sup>
    century and advent of digitization. It is precisely because handwriting is
    no longer a necessary technique for communication that it can be
    rediscovered as an intimate practice. As noted by Neef, in a longer
    historical perspective, handwriting has constantly been metamorphosing, and
    its current incarnation can in many ways remind us of 18<sup>th</sup>
    century conceptions of handwriting before education came to dominate the
    practice.
</p>
<p><img src="img/04-wickberg.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 4. From the Reddit thread r/PenmanshipPorn.</p>

<p>
    The subreddit r/PenmanshipPorn increasingly contains short videos and GIFs
    of writing mixed with images of scripts. One user posted a video of writing
    the Hallmark logo with calligraphy supplies, and reactions to the post are
    revealing of the intimate associations that users make. Comments include,
    “I swear I got the chills when I saw that,” “Mmmm,” and other expressions
    of affect. The letter “M” in particular received a lot of praise, one user
    calling it “the most beautiful thing I’ve seen in my life,” and another
    writing, “my jaw dropped.” The community also insists on correct usage of
    words: the pen of a calligrapher is to be called “nib,” and frequently the
    exact model is mentioned, in this case Brause no. 361. Interestingly, the
    post is also praised for its likeness to the Hallmark logo, which would
    indicate that it is the physical intimacy of the hand that produces the
    effect, rather than the aesthetic appearance of the original design, at
    least to some extent. Outside of the subreddit penmanship porn has grown
    immensely in popularity and is attached to an existing post-digital
    mindfulness trend. One blog post titled “16 pen porn videos that will calm
    down your anxious mind” praised the Instagram account Kellycreates, which
    boasts 600,000 followers, as “the Beyoncé of pen nibs and brush lettering.”
    This particular blog is posted on the news platform <em>Elite Daily</em>,
    which describes itself as “the ultimate digital destination for millennial
    women who are discovering the world and themselves in the process.” The
    author of the post, Emily Arata, is an editor who writes about the
    “unlikely ways in which millennials connect with each other.” The captions
    for the pen porn videos she posts are all crafted in the same
    affect-oriented and mindful style, and Arata writes that one video will
    “quell the rising anxiety in your esophagus” by watching a “stable handed
    lady wield a pen,” and describes another as a millennial mandala. In all of
    the posts of penmanship porn there is of course no recourse for just
    reading the words of praise literally, but the discursive practice is still
    revealing of what post-digital handwriting is. At this point Karen Barad’s
    thought can be useful to elaborate. The dynamic relationality of the
    intra-action which constitutes the phenomenon of penmanship porn consists
    in the becoming together of an archaic technique, physical affect, digital
    media, and the humans that post and comment. In an agential realist account
    of post-digital handwriting, this specific material reconfiguration enacts
    meanings and properties differently. Therefore, it would be wrong to posit
    an original handwriting which could die or survive. Rather, like Neef
    points out, handwriting was always transforming, or rather, being enacted
    differently, in formations of which post-digital handwriting is likely the
    most recent, but by no means exclusionary.
</p>
<p><img src="img/05-wickberg.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 5. Instagram account of calligraphist Seblester with comment from user.</p>

<p>
    Seb Lester is a type designer and calligraphist whose work often features
    on Buzzfeed lists of penmanship porn. His account is followed by one
    million users, to whom he posts videos and images of himself writing. The
    soothing and calming effects described on the lists are echoed in the many
    comments his posts receive. Many, of course, praise style and technique,
    but a fair amount of users explicitly comment on the relaxation and peace
    of mind they experience in watching the imagery of his penmanship. One
    user, replying to a short video review of a fountain pen, posted the
    following: “As I sit in the ER with chest pains, neck pain and nausea I am
    watching this and it is helping relax me &amp; my PTSD/anxiety. Listening
    to your voice and watching the calligraphy- ah thank you.”
</p>
<p>
    With erotic overtones, Penmanship Porn is an example of a post-digital
    re-appropriation of the 19<sup>th</sup> century romantic conception of
    handwriting. It is striking how this quality and cultural value, which in
    the 20<sup>th</sup> century successively faded away, can reappear through
    social media and user experience. The intimate quality of the calligraphic
    technique seems to suggest slowness and relaxation, which disrupts the
    rapid information flow in these social media spheres. In the last example,
    a user reportedly even finds relief through an Instagram video of
    calligraphy in an acute and very stressful situation. However, it is
    construed that post-digital handwriting disrupts the logic of social media
    feeds.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bullet Journaling and Post-Digital Mindfulness</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Bullet Journal describes itself as “the analog method for the digital
    age.” It consists of a system of handwritten notes which are said to
    increase productivity and focus. The concept appears as an intentional way
    out of the fully immersive digital condition without actually leaving it,
    but rather integrating the constraints and physical space of handwriting
    into the digital. The concept is further described by the company Bullet
    Journal as “mindfulness disguised as productivity.” Bullet journaling seems
    to draw on the perceived psychological benefits of handwriting that are the
    main feature of penmanship porn, yet pairing it with the promise of
    increased productivity and focus which could make its user more present as
    they navigate their post-digital lives. As such, the company’s product
    consists of a book describing the practice, the notebooks and pens for
    doing it, and an app which transfers the notes taken by hand back into the
    smartphone of the user. It is thus not a question of abandonment of the
    digital that has prevailed in some cases of post-digital culture as
    described by Cramer, but rather a seamless weaving together of what has
    been understood as analog and digital, now arguably beyond a meaningful
    distinction. The Bullet Journal, shortened as BuJo, has received extensive
    praise from both traditional and digital news from the BBC and LA Times to
    Buzzfeed, Pinterest and various blogs. BBC’s heading reads, “Why paper is
    the real killer app.” Running through the hype of ‘BuJo’ are the promise of
    better mental health and increased productivity. The fact that a product
    that is first and foremost a technique of age-old pen and paper listing and
    planning can appear as more interesting than the endless organizer apps
    available today neatly summarizes the attraction of post-digital
    handwriting. Its users are not technophobically opposing new technology but
    are often younger persons leading a digital life with a strong social media
    presence who choose BuJo as an effective means of strengthening their
    mental stability and high paced living.

    This reincarnation of a school-taught skill that used to be a necessary
    means of communication would probably have seemed unlikely only ten years
    ago, not least to those who lamented its imminent death, but there is in
    fact a growing body of research that supports the claims about the benefits
    of handwriting. A recent study by Muller &amp; Oppenheimer showed that
    students who took notes on laptops performed far worse on conceptual
    questions than those who took notes in longhand, suggesting that
    handwriting produce a deeper learning process (2014). Several studies
    confirm the general hypothesis of improved memory capacity and learning
    abilities, and studies from embodied cognition have shown that the “mere
    physical act of shaping letters activates the motor memory in the
    sensorimotor zones of the brain and reinforces the learning process” (Pérez
    Alonso, 265). There thus seems to be substantial truth to the claim about
    handwriting, and to the extent that these psychological processes were
    underlying penmanship long before digitization; the repurposing of them in
    a post-digital logic follows a general pattern of media practices changing
    and adapting historically. It was not until it was no longer the default
    mode of communication and information processing that these qualities could
    be discovered. Another recent study has showed that haptic aspects of the
    movement of the hand in its connection to the paper and the environment in
    which the writing takes place are bound by an intricate pattern which is
    lost in keyboard typing because of the split it introduces: “Therefore,
    learning perceptually variable instances of a category enhanced
    performance, suggesting that handwriting facilitates symbol understanding
    by virtue of its environmental output: supporting the notion of
    developmental change though brain-body-environment interactions” (Li &amp;
    James 2016).

    The analysis of bullet journaling and the new research on benefits of
    handwriting points to a historical shift underlying a change in media
    practices. As digitization has increasingly turned writing into image in
    the sense that keys on the keyboard produce a visual/verbal pattern where
    writing becomes image in a novel way. This explains why the post-digital
    revival of handwriting on paper is focused on the visual aspect of it. It
    is writing by hand on paper after writing with keyboard and screens, thus
    literally post-digital. The practice is now often understood as visual art
    rather than verbal communication, and haptic and sensomotorical qualities
    turns it into a phenomenon of intimacy. This is further supported by the
    calligraphy revival exemplified by the Instagram account of Seb Lester. The
    fact that Routledge Revival just republished the almost
one-hundred-year-old graphological study <em>The Psychology of Handwriting</em> (2018) also speaks to this growing
    interest in the practice of handwriting today. Recent advancements in
    neurological research have been successfully implementing handwriting
    analysis as a tool for early detection of Alzheimer, suggesting there may
    be more to the connection between personality composition and handwriting
    (Ghaderyan 2018).

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>
    Another way of approaching the complex phenomenon of post-digital
    handwriting would be to think with Heidegger that the act of handwriting
    and the tools of pen and paper until recently remained withdrawn to us, and
    appeared as they are in this historical moment through digitization because
    they’ve become broken tools, at least for its former purpose of surviving
any and all everyday rapid communications. As Heidegger elaborates in <em>Being and Time</em>, an object can be ready-to-hand (<em>Zuhanden</em>
    ), meaning it is part of everyday practice and reveals itself through its
    handiness (69). When an object like the hammer&mdash;Heidegger’s most famous
    example&mdash;breaks, it instead becomes present-at-hand, <em>Vorhanden</em>
    (96). As its everyday function is interrupted we can grasp the piece of
    metal for what it is, rather than only seeing the expected outcome of its
    function, like the nail in the wall. In the post-digital realm,
    pen and paper have become present-at-hand in Heidegger’s terminology, since
    they are broken insofar as they no longer function effectively. As
    handwritten notes and their corresponding tools of pen and paper were used
    for everyday communication both personally and professionally, they were
    known in their relational nature as equipment for a purpose, but not as
    what they were in themselves (Heidegger 98). You may still use them to
    scribble something, but when communicating practical information to a
    friend, they no longer serve their purpose. Pen, paper, and the resulting
note have become discernable and deconcealed as Being in the world (<em>Dasein</em>). The scribbled note is also present-at-hand because it is
    present in our consciousness, and thus possible to exhibit as such. To
    better understand this process, Barad’s critical concepts are useful. The
    broken pen and paper, now in the 21st century present-at-hand and in our
    consciousness, are <em>intra-acting</em> with a digital infrastructure
    whose endpoint is often a smartphone resting in a human hand. The
    smartphone, in contrast, is very much ready-to-hand. The various cases of
    penmanship porn and bullet journaling discussed in this essay support the
    hypothesis that the phenomenon of post-digital handwriting is dependent on
    a historically new ontological status, in which the intimacy and the haptic
    dimension of writing are activated as the intra-action of hand, writing
    tools, mind and image. The pen and paper are not posited as opposed to the
    keyboard, but are rather part of a complex post-digital infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    The emergence of post-digital handwriting can thus be related to two
    significant onto-epistemological features. The first is the brokenness of
    the tools of communication (pen and paper) and their consequential
    appearance in our consciousness as present-at-hand. The second is the
    co-constitutive nature of the intra-actions of these tools and digital
    infrastructure resulting in their visibility as digital artifacts. In all
    three cases discussed in this article, post-digital handwriting disrupts
    the fast logic of the social media feed by drawing users into qualities of
    slowness and intimacy. Strange as it may seem, this is true for Trump’s
    signature and handwriting as well, since it is the human and personal
    haptic qualities of political agency that is brought forth. As communities
    gathering around Penmanship porn and BuJo suggest, post-digital handwriting
    is less about semantic communication and more about visual qualities and
    physical imaginaries about human intimacy and closeness. Capturing the
    essence of the post-digital paradox, these communities form and cultivate
    these qualities within a digital infrastructure and become meaningful in
    this intra-activity.
