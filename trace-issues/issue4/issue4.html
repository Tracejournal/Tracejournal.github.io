        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The “digital” has been contested as shorthand inverse of the “material”
            just as much by now as it has been critically insisted to be one and the
            irreducible same. In the former instance, digital has been confused with
            “virtual” and imagined in aesthetic terms lifted somewhat wholesale from
            William Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em>; in the latter, the digital has, in more of
            Gibson’s words, “everted”—turned inside out—and been further proven to have
            always been starkly so. But these characterizations of “virtual worlds” vs.
            “just vectors and wires” have been covered many times over, to the degree
            that even scholarship in the newest veins of new materialism merely doth
            protest too much. Perhaps then a shift in, if not so much a dramatic break
            with, the ways we so far discuss digital materiality is in order. Some new
            material in new materialism is due for the digital.
        </p>
        <p>
            This fourth issue of <em>Trace</em>, “Writing New Material for Digital Culture”
            explores newer new materialist approaches to the digital. For new
            materialist and object-oriented philosophies have continued to play a
            prominent role in discourses on digital media. Theorists such as Bruno
            Latour (2005), Jane Bennett (2010), and Ian Bogost (2012) prompt us to
            conceive of the material world as a “vibrant” network of objects endowed
            with agency, intention, and desire. Scholars in new media and digital
            rhetoric, such as Jussi Parikka (2015) and David Rieder (2017) have begun
            to extend new materialist philosophies into an examination of our
            historical and contemporary relationship to electronic media and digital
            culture. This emerging trend posits that digital artifacts not only enact
            material effects within diverse media ecologies but actively resist the
            strict binaries between “the digital” and “the physical” that often
            circulate in discussions of new media and inform ecological thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Still Life with Rhetoric, Laurie Gries outlines her new materialist
            approach to rhetoric by claiming that “a thing’s rhetorical meaning is
            constituted by the consequences that emerge in its various material
            encounters, affects, and intra-actions” (29). Gries pursues her new
            materialist rhetoric by tracing the digital and material circulation of the
            famous Obama Hope image. In a similar vein, Nicole Starosielski takes a new
            materialist approach by bringing to surface the overlooked structures of
            undersea cable networks that physically support Internet services. Lastly,
            Lori Emerson’s work with the Media Archaeology Lab at UC-Boulder
            demonstrates the importance of engaging with the material traces of our
            digital histories, from magic lanterns and typewriters to early modems and
            video game systems. The diverse methods taken up by these scholars serve as
            just a few examples of how new materialism offers a productive framework
            for grounding the study of digital rhetoric and media.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what this issue contributes to the conversation is a more human and
            (differently post)humanist perspective for new materialist discourse on the
            digital. One of the greatest overcorrects of posthumanist and new
            materialist scholarship has been, in the words of John Schilb, that much of
            its especially object-oriented variety “trivializes, even trashes, the
            contributions of human actors” (“The Matter of Writing”). As David M. Grant
            and Jennifer Clary-Lemon currently prepare their edited collection
            Decolonial Conversations in Posthuman and New Material Rhetorics, we
            present this issue in alliance with their work to “put forward a vision for
            more equitable new materialisms or posthumanisms” (“Call for Papers”). In
            general, the articles in this collection explore how digital technologies
            can serve to both amplify and erase marginalized identities, perspectives,
            and epistemologies. In doing so, the scholars in this issue challenge the
            field of digital studies to not neglect the importance of human
            perspectives in the rush to theorize the agential qualities of digital and
            material actors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The contributors to <em>Trace</em> Issue 4: “Writing New Material for Digital
            Culture” forward many compelling insights regarding the continuing
            imbrication of digital media within our everyday lives and spaces. In doing
            so, contributors take up a variety of approaches to the study of digital
            culture as a material phenomenon, from case studies exploring the
            materiality of online discourses to creative explorations of the
            compositional affordances of digital mapping technologies. The
            methodological and theoretical diversity of these projects not only
            demonstrates the value of cross-disciplinary perspectives within digital
            rhetoric and new media studies but also provides generative models for the
            future of scholarly production within these and other fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            Issue 4 begins by reevaluating a common theoretical frame within new media
            scholarship: obsolescence. In “What a Waste: Why Obsolescence is the Wrong
            Lens for E-Waste,” Elizabeth F. Chamberlain questions the dominance of
            obsolescence as the critical lens for e-waste in new materialist
            scholarship. Her incisive analysis raises necessary and nuanced agitations
            on the term for the ways in which it traffics in linear understandings of
            device lifecycles and the places where they go to “die” and are dumped. She
            takes new materialist scholarship to task for reliance on obsolescence as
            lens resulting in narratives of “white guilt” that strip developing nations
            receiving e-waste from the West of their agency, framed merely as victims
            rather than capable participants in technological craft and discourse.
            Navigating through a wealth of case studies but focusing particularly on
            examples from Agbogbloshie, Ghana, Chamberlain moves the discussion of
            e-waste and critical interventions into the problem from fetishization of
            “artist-archaeologists” to a fuller picture of more “utilitarian
            upcyclers.” She works to enrich the framework for e-waste to include
            developing nations as very much part of the solution as well as problem,
            rather than allow the established trajectory of current new materialist
            scholarship that imagines obsolescence as “our” concern foisted onto
            “them.” Her article globalizes new materialist thought beyond its often too
            white and Western narrow foci.
        </p>
        <p>
            As other contributors to issue 4 demonstrate, digital media facilitate the
            circulation and amplification of marginalized voices. In “Activism,
            Actancy, and Delivery in Digital Human Rights Rhetoric,” Laura Sparks
            analyzes digital advocacy campaigns through a new materialist and
            posthumanist lens. Sparks notes that advocating for more equitable
            conditions for marginalized humans requires attending to the role of
            nonhuman actants within emerging digital ecologies. Through this, Sparks
            demonstrates how delivery in online spaces is enmeshed within networks of
            “distributed agencies” that make it difficult to track the rhetorical
            impact of activist initiatives. However, drawing on new materialist
            thinkers such as Jane Bennett, Sparks nonetheless demonstrates a viable
            approach to attending to these nonhuman, material-rhetorical forces through
            a close analysis of several Amnesty International campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the international to the local, new materialism further encourages
            research practices that acknowledge the entanglement of human and nonhuman
            agencies within digital-physical environments. In “(Digital) Objects with
            Thing-Power: A New Materialist Perspective of Spaces, Places, and Public
            Memory,” April O’Brien conducts a spatio-rhetorical analysis of Pendleton,
            South Carolina. O’Brien’s analysis demonstrates how historical
            representation operates as a material and rhetorical force that can serve
            to whitewash a town’s racist and colonial past. However, despite the
            revisionist narratives promulgated by the local discourses and historical
            markers scattered throughout Pendleton, O’Brien demonstrates how human and
            nonhuman actors—dilapidated buildings, rusty memorials, garbage dumps—serve
            as traces of “another history” that collectively speak to the
            infrastructural injustices enacted against black communities in Pendleton
            and throughout the American south. Ultimately, O’Brien models a generative
            approach for how the field of writing and rhetoric might draw on the
            non-linear, spatial affordances of digital mapping technologies to document
            marginalized histories on-location.
        </p>
        <p>
            Contributors to Issue 4 also address the seemingly immaterial world of
            social media networks to show just how material its complications can be.
            In “How to (News)feed a Crowd: Transformation and Collaboration in Digital
            Food Communities,” Kelli Gill considers how online food and recipe videos
            facilitate spaces for engaging in public discourse about culturally and
            politically sensitive topics, counter to the typical toxic domain of online
            conversation. As Gill notes, our relationships to food are highly
            rhetorical, imbricated within socio-cultural factors like race, ethnicity,
            geography, and class. Through a close analysis of several online recipe
            comment sections, Gill demonstrates how the participatory and playful
            nature of online food communities offers an emerging intersectional space
            for digital publics to engage in cross-cultural dialogue about these and
            other topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Entangled in the “post-digital” logics of these digital publics, new media
            also transform our relationship to inscription practices once thought of as
            exclusively material. In “New Materialism and the Intimacy of Post-digital
            Handwriting,” Adam Wickberg analyzes the changing ontologies of the
            practice of handwriting in overwhelmingly digital and digitized cultures.
            Wickberg takes on the post-digital as an epistemic condition caught between
            the ubiquity of the digital and the counter-resurgence of the analog that
            is critical to the understanding of new materialism. He traces the
            surfacing phenomenon of post-digital handwriting, defined as “writing on
            paper by hand which is then digitized as image and disseminated online,” to
            claim that handwriting is not disappearing but rather is transforming from
            a practice of representation and verbal communication to one of visual
            phenomena that invigorates the post-digital with qualities of intimacy and
            singularity it is purported to lack. His article focuses on three case
            studies to make its argument, the political signature of Donald Trump, the
            communities formed around the concept of “Penmanship Porn,” and the recent
            mindfulness trend of Bullet Journaling. Through each example, Wickberg
            emphasizes that post-digital handwriting digitally augments seemingly
            analog concepts of intimacy and singularity, in other words, the supposed
            personal individuality expressed in handwriting, through not an opposition
            of material substrate but a rather complex confluence of post-digital
            infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Building off the conversations broached by Issue 4’s contributors, a new
            materialist approach to digital culture requires alternative research
            practices that challenge us to (mis)use emerging technologies in generative
            rhetorical contexts. In “Transducing Embodied Inscription Practices with
            the Kinect,” Matthew Halm performs an object lesson of sorts highlighting
            the motion sensing input device Kinect, a videogame peripheral designed to
            accompany the Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows computers. By
            analyzing the Kinect as an “example which behaves differently from writing
            but which bears unexpected similarity to it,” Halm endeavors to deconstruct
            what is actually so unnatural about “natural user interfaces,” such as
            Microsoft’s device. With the Kinect serving as a guiding case study, Halm
            argues that a posthuman understanding of writing should help distance
            conceptions of composition from traditional models of representation that
            limit the approaches we can take to the complexity of writing as bodily
            event. Rather than continue in frameworks that emphasize the
            anthropological and intellectual practices of writing as an interior
            phenomenon, Halm analyzes the deep exteriority of writing through a
            transition to transduction, or, the “process of residual transference as a
            result of proximity between entities.” Transduction describes the
            tendencies for writer and writing to leave traces upon one another—not the
            writer controlling the writing nor the writing the writer, but a material
            confluence between the two that yields surprising new understandings of
            what inscription really means outside of just the representational.
            Ultimately, Halm’s posthumanist approach to the “natural” user interface
            challenges us to expand the very definition of what we mean by writing in
            digitally ambient cultures.

            Finally, Issue 4 concludes with a pedagogical focus to “newly materialize”
            the ideas considered throughout, and one that indicates in these frameworks
            just how daunting multimodal composing can be for both teacher and student.
            Fortunately, in “Following Suit: A Pursuit of Material Process in
            Multimodal Composition,” Kali Jo Wacker offers writing teachers some useful
            theoretical and practical guidelines for attending to the complex material
            processes inherent to multimodal production. Drawing on insights from new
            materialist theory and composition pedagogy, Wacker analyses a self-created
            art gallery exhibit that serves to illuminate the highly personal and
            enmeshed nature of multimodal composing as a digital and material
            phenomenon. In doing so, Wacker demonstrates how multimodality is not a
            discrete collection of individual objects or texts but rather a much more
            dynamic and entangled system of emergent rhetorical interaction. From this,
            Wacker offers some key insights and best-practices for incorporating
            multimodal projects into the writing classroom that might better attend to
            processes and practices of revision, preservation, and performance.

            What all of the articles compiled for <em>Trace</em> Issue 4: “Writing New Material
            for Digital Culture” work to advance is a different way of tending to the
            kinds of concerns that have defined a field. What we propose in presenting
            the critical work of these various contributors is that previously radical
            work to decenter the human perspective and complicate traditionalist
            understandings of the digital has itself become traditionalist. Such work
            becomes part of an ethos that overcorrects to disavow the human altogether
            at a precarious time when cultural rhetorics are sorely reminding us that
            some people are still debating who “counts” as human to begin with. What
            this issue therefore presents is a newly prismatic angle on which to ponder
            new materialism as part of a more equitable project to break outside of
            non/human binaries and better value more and all forms of agency animating
            digital culture. May the collective body of work here complicate the
            conversations continually materializing in digital rhetoric and writing,
            media studies, and more.
