<h2><strong>What a Waste: Why Obsolescence Is the Wrong Lens for E-Waste</strong></h2>
<h3>Elizabeth F. Chamberlain </h3>
<h4>Arkansas State University</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: right;">(<em>Published March 11, 2020</em>)</h4>


<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
    New materialists have compellingly argued that technology has been too
    often represented in scholarship as a space of immaterial possibilities
    (e.g. Gabrys; Huhtamo; Parikka, “A Geology”; Taffel). “The weightless
    rhetoric of cyberspace,” Sy Taffel cautions, “is underpinned by vast
    amounts of matter” (19). Perhaps, as that old <em>New Yorker</em> cartoon
    famously proclaimed, no one knows you’re a dog on the Internet, but new
    materialists remind us that the hard drive under your paws contains coltan
    mined in the war-torn Congo, that the polystyrene in the case will be
    difficult to recycle, and that if landfilled the mercury in the flat screen
    might leach into the groundwater. Woof, indeed.
</p>
<p>
    In answering the call to attend to technological matter, new materialists
    have enthusiastically traced materials up and downstream. Some have
    considered the environmental and cultural impacts of mining (Parikka “New
    Materialism”; Taffel). Others have followed the material flows of
    electronics after their “obsolescence” (Cortez; Gabrys; Rust). Many have
    addressed the ways that electronic waste (e-waste) pollutes environments
    and damages the health and lives of workers in electronics junkyards
    (Cubitt; Gabrys; Grossman; Minter; Pezzulo; Rust; Yang). These critics
    appropriately point to ways that e-waste is a growing international
    problem; contemporary technological culture creates massive amounts of
    waste that we have not yet as an international community figured out how to
    manage ethically and responsibly at the necessary scale.
</p>
<p>
    Yet this common new materialist figuring of e-waste ignores a large and
    important component of what Karen Barad calls the material technosocial
    “entanglements” in the life of electronics. In taking up Walter Benjamin’s
    call to interrogate “the rags, the refuse” of history (460) and Garnet
    Hertz and Jussi Parikka’s call to consider “zombie media,” new materialists
    describe a life of electronics that is artificially centered on the
    electronics’ first use. The standard teleology of many new materialist
    depictions of material flows of e-waste—from a shiny developed-world
    purchase, to the device’s planned obsolescence, to the user pitching the
    device into the developing world’s waste stream—often does not account for
    the increasing use of electronics in the developing world. There are over 6
    billion mobile cellular subscriptions in the developing world
    (International Telecommunications Union), and many of those users rely on
    secondhand electronics. Some of the devices on today’s Best Buy shelves
    will remain entangled with societies of users for twenty or thirty years,
    long beyond the point that they become “obsolete” in developed countries.
    Thus, any representation of e-waste that calls a technological object
    “dead” when it leaves its first user in the US or UK necessarily ignores
    the rich material lives of electronics in countries that rely on secondhand
    electronic imports for their connection to online society.
</p>
<p>
    Narratives of the developing world’s use of electronics have been dominated
    by images of toxic pollution and dangerous waste-picking since 2009, when
    “Ghana: Digital Dumping Ground,” a <em>Frontline</em> documentary, made
    highly polluted electronics junkyards famous. In the decade since, however,
    export from the US and UK to Ghana and China has become less and less
    common; increasingly, e-waste is generated within developing nations. While
    I have no doubt that poor nations bear an undue environmental burden of
    e-waste (in accordance with the ecocritical axiom), slowing consumption in
    wealthier nations, if possible, will not solve the problem. Stopping
    e-waste exports, if possible, will not solve the problem. Even in the least
    developed countries worldwide, 30% of 15- to 24-year-olds are Internet
    users (International Telecommunications Union). Most of these users,
    however, are not represented by new materialist descriptions of “users” in
    the life of technology.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, figuring e-waste as solely a “problem” unfairly presents
    poorer nations’ electronics reuse as a sad afterthought. One of Parikka’s
    calls to study e-waste describes it as the “materialism of dirt and bad
    matter” (“New Materialism” 99). This description of e-waste ignores its
    lingering potentiality; the uses that Ghanaian junkyard workers find in
    secondhand technology are not simply “bad encounters that reduce the
    vitalities of material assemblages” (Parikka “New Materialism” 99). Rather,
    these junkyards are often the site of rebirth of electronics—the ashes that
    breathe a second, third, and/or fourth life into electronics once called
    “obsolete.” Surely we cannot call such rebirths unequivocally “bad
    encounters.” What, indeed, could be a more vital use of a material
    assemblage than when a Ghanaian teenager is searching online for pulse-code
    modulation jobs on a refurbished Dell desktop that has passed from use in
    an American university, crossed the ocean through a network of
    international scrap dealers, and been repaired with parts that were
    scavenged—maybe even from the “blighted” Ghana scrapyard Agbogbloshie
    (Burrell 48)?
</p>
<p>
    In this paper, I ask: How would the material ecology of electronics change
    if device design and manufacturing considered users beyond the first? How
    could new materialist understandings of technology change if we shook off
    the teleology imposed by a focus on “waste” and “obsolescence,” and instead
    embraced an extended international life of devices? What stories of
    electronics are obscured by the tired repetition of the environmental
    dangers of burning wires? I argue that many new materialist approaches to
    e-waste, by reiterating outdated stories about export and by perpetuating a
    wealthy nation-centric teleological narrative about the life of
    electronics, may reinforce the very structures of obsolescence they aim to
    critique.
</p>
<p><strong>Behind the Artist-Archaeologist, A Legion of More Utilitarian Upcyclers</strong></p>

<p>
    Let me begin with a vignette that points to the varying potentials of
    different approaches to e-waste materialism. The setting: the largest
    e-waste dump in the world, Agbogbloshie, in Accra, Ghana, which has been
    the subject of dozens of documentaries aiming to expose the dangers and
    ecological horror of inexperienced electronics recycling. From
    Agbogbloshie, an artist named Joseph Awuah-Darko harvested discarded
    electronics and mechanical components to assemble the first in a series of
    afrofuturist grandfather clocks. The clock was sold in November 2017 to an
    unnamed British philanthropist. The clock’s artist, also frequently known
    by his performance name Okuntakinte, is a 21-year-old British-born Ghanaian
    university student and musical performer who founded the Agbogblo.Shine
    initiative. In addition to turning e-waste into high-end furniture,
    Agbogblo.Shine aims to provide safety equipment and vocational training for
    scrap collectors in the most dangerous parts of Agbogbloshie. In December
    2017, the initiative was awarded a $6,900 Ford Foundation grant for a
    project that will produce 1200 stools for rural Ghana schools by 2020
    (@AJEnglish; @Okuntakinte, “Today, in our”; Amoah; Yire).
</p>
<p>
    Okuntakinte’s work fits in beautifully with the work of scholars who have
    taken up Hertz and Parikka’s call toward “zombification” of out-of-use
    electronics. In “Zombie Media,” Hertz and Parikka describe the ways that
    artistic practices like circuit bending and hardware hacking fight back
    against the corporate strategy of planned obsolescence, which are
    deliberate decisions “artificially decreasing the life-span of consumer
    commodities . . . and stimulating the need to purchase” (143). Since Marcel
    Duchamp put a urinal in a museum and called it a “readymade,” Hertz and
    Parikka argue, the art world has found ways to repurpose commodities as
    objects deserving higher-brow consideration (426). Quoting Erkki Huhtamo,
    Hertz and Parikka laud the rebirth of the “‘artist-engineer’” archetype
    into the “‘artist-archaeologist,’” an artisan dedicated to breaking open
    the black boxes of technology with a kind of DIY aesthetic, exploring the
    history of media by literally tinkering with its insides (150).
</p>
<p>
    Following the “zombie media” call, many scholars have turned an eye to this
    kind of artistic upcycling as a media archaeological practice that fights
technological obsolescence and black-boxing. For example, in a <em>Craft Research</em> study of The Trons, “a robot garage band made from
    recycled materials,” Emit Snake-Beings describes how “a DiY craft aesthetic . . . allows material agency to become part of the making process” (55).
    The Trons, he explains, are a creation of New Zealand musician Greg Locke
    and consist of four robotic band members made of discarded speakers and
    microphones and scrap metal. “They” have released albums inscribed on
    discarded aluminum pie plates (63-5), and Locke reports incorporating the
    ways that the decaying salvaged material of the robots introduces errors
    into the sound of the music (69). In Hertz and Parikka’s formulation, Locke
    is a classic artist-archaeologist; Snake-Beings argues that The Trons
    redress the problems of e-waste:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Art and craft practices that utilize discarded materials and redundant
    technologies have recently been described as an engagement with ‘Zombie
    media’, signifying the ecological dangers of discarded electronic e-waste
    as significant threats for natural ecologies in the future. The use of
    ‘Zombie media’ brings to light the flow of toxins leached into the
    eco-system when e-waste is dismantled, suggesting that technology never
    really ‘dies’ but becomes ‘part of a wider pattern of circulation’ (Hertz
    and Parikka 2015). The reuse of apparently ‘dead’ media, in this sense,
    highlights dominant discourses of technology as a disposable commodity,
    with The Trons offering an alternative discourse based on a more
    sustainable attitude to technology. (58-9)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
    The Trons have a compelling DIY aesthetic, and their craft certainly seems
    to me to call into question the polish, personality, and finesse we expect
    both out of highly produced music and out of robots; in Locke’s reuse of
    electronic components, given that robots have perhaps the most apparent
    life of any electronic product, I see some thoughtful provocations on the
    notion that these components are “dead.” Yet I am far less convinced that
    this project presents “a more sustainable attitude to technology” or
    “signif[ies] the ecological dangers of discarded electronic e-waste” (5-6),
    How does constructing robots out of discarded technological devices
    represent an ecologically sustainable attitude? What dangers of e-waste,
    precisely, are called up by the presence of a robot band? Might there, in
    fact, be some counterintuitive danger in offhandedly and uncritically
    equating e-waste with “danger” as Snake-Beings does here?
</p>
<p>
    Snake-Beings’s other work on what he terms “techno-animism” engages with a
similar DIY craft approach to “media zombification.” In a 2018 <em>Continuum</em> article, he describes a workshop where people make
    creative use of e-waste, turning discarded electronics into electronic
    musical instruments. Snake-Beings’s research subjects thus resemble the
    prototypical artist-archaeologist described in “Zombie Media”: Reed
    Ghazala, a circuit-bending hippie who has turned old Speak &amp; Spells
    into ethereal, half-familiar theremins. As artist-archaeologists, Ghazala
    and Snake-Beings treat old technology with reverence, tinged with a kind of
    affected pretense; the artist-archaeologist seeks cultural enlightenment in
    a pile of trash.
</p>
<p>
    More than a few other uptakes of the “zombie media” call similarly claim to
    be addressing problems such as overconsumption of electronics and the
    toxicity of e-waste that ends up in landfills, while forwarding a nostalgic
    veneration of old technology that emphasizes a punk aesthetic over making
    something with functional potential. Nathanael Bassett and Jason Archer,
    for instance, also cite Hertz and Parikka’s “zombie media” call, when they
    describe a keyboard nostalgia movement; a group of old keyboard fans wax
    poetic about the “haptic experience” of keyboards that have not been in
    production for decades:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    The enthusiasm for vintage or discontinued keyfeel also motivates a type of
    historical knowledge that allows for the care and recomposition of dead
    media. In 2016, the Brand New Model F Keyboards project brought back IBM’s
    Model F into production for the first time since 1994 and produced over a
    $140,000 worth of orders. (246)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
    As in the case of The Trons, I question the argument that this kind of
    “care” of “dead media” represents a substantially different or more
    sustainable attitude towards electronics. Indeed, the attitude Bassett and
    Archer describe instead seems to be a kind of consumerism repackaged for
    the iconoclast class; this reading is supported by the fact that, given the
    opportunity to purchase new electronics to fill the nostalgic impulse,
    collectors quickly amassed $140,000 in orders for a keyboard that had not
    been state of the art for more than twenty years.
</p>
<p>
    I have many of the same misgivings about the nostalgic “feminist ROM
    [read-only memory] hacks” that Jaime Lee Kirtz describes in her 2018
    article about feminist hacking and making practices. ROM hackers make
    changes to the code or hardware of video games, often old console games.
    Kirtz describes several ROM hacking projects from a woman named Rachel
    Simone Weil, who, among other projects, hacked Super Mario Bros. to add
    Hello Kitty and retheme the game in girly pinks and baby blues. This
    project, Kirtz says, is aligned in sexist obscurity with the work that
    poorly paid factory workers put into electronics:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    From the forgotten labor of the migrant women workers in Chinese
    electronics factories to the lack of attention paid to feminist artists and
    game developers creating deep hacks of classic games, women have been
    excluded from the mainstream conceptualization of the video game industry
    and larger tech culture. . . . As such, ROM hacking video games, along with
    critically analyzing the histories of the hacked media, which includes the
    process of media resurrection for ‘new uses, contexts and adaptations,’
    outlines an approach that can effectively extend conceptions of feminist
    hacking/making (Hertz and Parikka 2012, 429).
</blockquote></p>
<p>
    Again, while Weil seems like a perfect example of the artist-archaeologist,
    I struggle to understand how her work in any way brings light to “the
    forgotten labor of the migrant women workers in Chinese electronics
    factories.” I do not see in her work, or in Kirtz’s analysis of it, a
    substantially different proposed attitude toward consumption, toward
    product lifecycles, or toward the flows of electronics that have fallen out
    of use.
</p>
<p>
    This kind of electronics re-use seems to me to be reminiscent of many
    neoliberal approaches to environmental struggles: it proposes individual
    solutions to the many systemic issues that make e-waste such a wicked
    problem. Such critiques might be made, Taffel argues, of the ethically
    sourced smartphone intended to combat problems of coltan mining. The phone,
    some might say, “merely represents the abdication of regulatory
    governmental practices by devolving ethical responsibility onto the
    individual, . . . thus creating minimal disturbance to mainstream corporate
    practices whilst affording the extension of the central mantra of
    neoliberal consumer culture: the right of the atomised individual to
    choose” (28). You can choose to make art out of your e-waste, these
projects say, and that elevation from functional object to <em>objet d’art</em> is an adequate means of demonstrating your ethical
    electronics consciousness. The individual solution of the
    artist-archaeologist may be no solution at all—it upends no systems of use
    or reuse; it destabilizes no structures of waste flow; it does not demand
    change of any kind at all.
</p>
<p>
    Worse, this nostalgic artistic treatment of e-waste might actually
    reinforce some of the more troubling practices of electronics flows: most
    e-waste goes through a period of dormancy and storage in first-users’ homes
    before it re-enters the electronics-using world through refurbishment,
    repair, or recycling. “At least 75 percent” of computers are “stockpiled”
    once they reach the end of their first useful life, Jennifer Gabrys
    explains: “Computer owners store the outmoded model as though there might
    be some way to recuperate its vanishing value, but the PC is one item that
    does not acquire value over time” (2). An artist-archaeologist treatment of
    e-waste gives that stockpiling a crafty purpose, as we might stockpile
    newspapers for papier-mache or bottle-caps to embed in a resin countertop.
    Meanwhile, the secondhand market in the US and abroad is robbed of the
    rapidly depreciating use value of still-functioning electronics. Internet
    cafes in Ghana are populated with computers that were new on the market
    seven or more years earlier, Jenna Burrell reports (160). If users in
    wealthy nations stopped stockpiling electronics as much and embraced a
    freer flow of electronics to poorer nations, might that improve the
    availability of more up-to-date devices in countries like Ghana? Might it
    lower prices for computers and make them more prevalent in schools and
    homes? Might the British appetite for e-waste grandfather clocks actually
    contribute to the cultural attitudes that make burning wires in the
    Agbogbloshie scrapyard among the more appealing jobs for young Ghanaians
    who have not been able to afford formal education?
</p>
<p>
    Following ethnographic investigations of a Chinese scrapyard much like
    Agbogbloshie, Adam Minter reported that people in the yard did not feel
    “that scrap was dumped on them. Instead, they actively imported it, or they
    migrated from other provinces to work on it. The pay, after all, couldn’t
    be beat, especially if you were uneducated and illiterate” (65-6).
    Furthermore, some of the African and Chinese junkyard practices like wire
burning that are so often represented with horror in places like <em>Frontline</em> are not actually so foreign. Minter, as the child of
    several generations of Minnesota scrap pickers, reported that in the 1980s
    and 1990s, his family “often paid contractors to burn our wire in farm
    fields outside Minneapolis,” and while his family no longer does, he knows
    “people who still do it in North Dakota—and there isn’t an impoverished
    Chinese farmer among them” (66). I do not mean to deny that stripping wires
    of their coatings by burning them is an environmental hazard, or to deny
    that using sloshing buckets of pure acid to break components off printed
    circuit boards is bad for workers’ health; clearly, in both cases, the
    environment and scrap workers’ health would be better suited by cleaner
    practices. Plus, when such things are still happening in the United States,
    their participants are likely violating environmental and occupational
    regulations that ensure most electronics recycling is cleaner. Such
    regulations are a net positive for the environment and workers’ health. But
    a representation of electronic material culture that presents the
    wire-burners and circuit-board strippers as victims of Western capitalism
    denies scrap workers’ agency, demonstrates ignorance that similar practices
    continue to occur in the West, and is undoubtedly not taking full account
    of the social entanglements of e-waste.
</p>
<p>
    This is one major problem with the lens of the artist-archaeologist, the
    lens of zombie media, even the lens of obsolescence as a whole: When we
    look at the story of Agbogbloshie, Okuntakinte is the clear
    artist-archaeologist hero. He zombifies the most toxic trash of Ghana and
    sells it to London elites in the form of an ironically clever decorative
    object, a grandfather clock that announces its own age and obsolescence
    with every analog tick. Narratives of upcycling focus on dead electronics
    as something to make rich Westerners nod solemnly in art galleries.
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, news reports of Okuntakinte’s work do not acknowledge that at
    Agbogbloshie, he may very well be the artisan practicing the least true
    upcycling. The scrap collectors with whom he works are turning waste into
    usable materials again. A report from Accra, conducted by the United
    Nations University and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative, suggests
    that countries like Ghana that have “an active informal recycling sector
    collect as much as 80-90% of their locally-generated e-waste” (United
    Nations University). Furthermore, that so-called “waste” on average
    “contains precious metal ‘deposits’ 40 to 50 times richer than ores mined
    from the ground” (United Nations University).
</p>
<p>
    The raw metals Agbogbloshie workers harvest will be sold to scrap dealers,
    who will pass them on—sometimes to local refurbishers, repairers, and
    remanufacturers, but sometimes to “factories and refineries in developed
    countries” (Ottaviani). Thus, that pile of burning wires from an early ‘90s
    server farm may very well yield gold that eventually ends up back in an
    iPhone. Agbogbloshie recyclers see in e-waste a literal piecemeal rebirth
    out of obsolescence where the artist-archaeologist sees only black-boxed
    media death. Rather than breaking open the black box of electronics,
    artist-archaeologists sometimes put a glass box around those still-valuable
    materials, materials that could readily be returned to the technological
    economy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>E-Waste Isn’t a One-Way Flow</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The role of the informal scrap recycling sector in returning raw materials
    to the global metals stream points to another problem with the teleological
    narrative of global e-waste flows. Most conversations about the global
    flows of e-waste follow a “Western consumption is bad” narrative. To
    illustrate, popular press publications use pictures of sick, sad youth in
    junkyards like Agbogbloshie and Guiyu and Foshan burning hunks of wires to
    strip their coatings and beating open CRTs to harvest the copper in the
    electron gun; as Burrell puts it, the secondhand electronics industry “has
    recently become very visible in a very selective way through coverage in
    Western media outlets of the electronic waste problem in developing
    countries” (181). The story is that “we” (people from wealthy nations) buy
    things, then trash them, and then pollute “their” homes (poor waste
    pickers). A version of this same story has been adopted by many media
    archaeologists. To tell this story, Hertz &amp; Parikka cite Sean Cubitt:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    ‘The digital realm is avant-garde to the extent that it is driven by
    perpetual innovation and perpetual destruction. The built-in obsolescence
    of digital culture, the endless trashing of last year’s model, the
    spendthrift throwing away of batteries and mobile phones and monitors and
    mice . . . and all the heavy metals, all the toxins, sent off to some
    god-forsaken Chinese recycling village . . . that is the digital avant-garde.’
    (151)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
    This narrative maps nicely onto white Western guilt: electronic waste is
    positioned as the sad, seedy underbelly of our eternal quest for the shiny
    and new. Westerners are linked with “digital culture,” with “perpetual
    innovation,” with “perpetual destruction.” Chinese recycling villages (and
    Ghanaian ones, by extension) are “god-forsaken.” This story articulates a
    one-way flow of e-waste, from the wealthy users who discard technology to
    the poor “god-forsaken” recyclers, whose lives are polluted by the unending
    tide of Western electronic trash. The implication of this narrative: If
    only Westerners were not so “spendthrift,” not so committed to “perpetual
    innovation,” not so cavalier about our “perpetual destruction,” we would
    improve the lives of the “god-forsaken” Chinese and Ghanaian waste pickers.
</p>
<p>
    Many new materialists repeat some version of this story. Here is Gabrys:
    “The disposal of electronics, then, follows a trajectory between developed
    and developing countries, where devices migrate from technology-rich
    regions to those places with an abundance of cheap labor and a high demand
    for raw materials” (91). In much of the same language, Rust says: “By
    shipping our e-waste overseas, those of us living in developed countries
are diverted from thinking about the problem” (93). Grossman’s <em>High Tech Trash</em> begins on “the shores of the Lianjiang River in
    southern China” with a woman melting a circuit board with “unprotected
    hands,” “primitive recycling” that is attributable to the “million or more
    tons of electronic waste that have been arriving there each year since the
    mid-1990s” (2).
</p>
<p>
    In this narrative lurk some troubling unchecked assumptions, assumptions
    that are not borne out by the reality of global e-waste flows. For
    instance, why do we assume that electronics consumption is a primarily
    Western phenomenon? Why do we assume that “recycling villages”
    internationally import all their scrap? Why are recycling villages
    “god-forsaken,” and why are their workers positioned as victims of
    electronic waste, without agency or technical skill?
</p>
<p>
    This narrative has been the reigning story about e-waste for decades, and
    while aspects of it are grounded in fact, many of its facts are actually
    decades out of date. Much discussion of e-waste comes from the Basel Action
    Network (BAN), an organization dedicated to enforcing the letter and spirit
    of the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of
    Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal (Basel Convention), which aimed to
    decrease the amount of hazardous waste sold from developed nations to
    developing nations. In 2006, parties to the Basel Convention held the first
    international convention on e-waste; Basel signatories “noting the rapid
    expansion in the transboundary movement of electronic waste worldwide and
    the risk to human health . . . declared the urgent need to promote public
    awareness of the risks” (Ogunseitan). Gabrys attributes to BAN the widely
    cited claim that “up to 80 percent of electronic waste from the United
    States and up to 70 percent of electronic waste from Europe is shipped to
    developing countries” (129). Yet this number is now decades out of date and
    not based on research of e-waste flows; it is from a 2002 BAN report, an
    “estimate” attributed to unnamed “informed recycling industry sources”
    (Puckett et al., 1). More recent research suggests otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    A March 2018 report by e-commerce company Jumia reported a cell phone
    penetration rate in Ghana of 119% (“Jumia Launches”); that is, there are
    119 mobile phones in Ghana for every 100 people. As time goes on, the
    notion that Western export of electronics is the biggest issue in e-waste
    is increasingly undermined by the reality of global e-waste generation:
    According to the Basel Convention’s own research, in 2010, 50-85% of
    e-waste in Africa was domestically generated; five West African countries
    alone were generating between 650,000 and 1,000,000 tonnes of e-waste per
    year (Schluep, et al., 10).
</p>
<p>
    The most comprehensive tracking of global e-waste flows further challenges
    the notion that e-waste is generated in developed countries and exported to
    developing countries. Several facets of media misreading of e-waste,
    controversies about export, and changes in transboundary movements of
    e-waste over time are targeted in Josh Lepawsky’s work on global e-waste
    flows (“The Changing Geography”; “From Actors to Networks”). In an article
    in <em>The Geographical Journal</em> reporting on 9400 trade transactions
    from 206 territories between 1996 and 2012, Lepawsky describes how global
    trade in e-waste changed in those fifteen years. For instance, the biggest
    importer of e-waste in 1996 was Indonesia; in 2012, not only had Indonesia
    become a net exporter of used electronics, but it exported those
    electronics primarily to countries with higher GDPs than itself. Exports do
    not move solely or even primarily, now, from the “global North” to the
    “global South”; the US is, in fact, now the third-largest <em>importer</em>
    of e-waste (primarily from Canada, but also from developing countries).
    Thus, Lepawsky argues, the Basel Convention’s focus on e-waste export is
    “increasingly irrelevant with respect to flows of e‐waste” (“The Changing
    Geography”).
</p>
<p>
    By presenting e-waste as a problem of the West, as a problem that “we”
    foist onto “them,” we blind ourselves to the way that e-waste is a global
    problem. More importantly, we blind ourselves to the ways that the
    solutions to e-waste might also be global. Lepawksy argues that instead of
    focusing on banning e-waste exports, truly addressing the global challenges
    of e-waste requires a different lens:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Solving that [e-waste] problem will not happen if it is imagined as one
    predominantly characterised by dumping of e‐waste from rich, ‘developed’
    countries of the ‘global North’ in poor, ‘developing’ countries of the
    ‘global South.’ … The dominant storyline about e‐waste misses the dynamic
    action of reuse, refurbishment, repair and recycling that accompanies this
    trade.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
    Ghana has deeply robust electronics reuse. Via manual disassembly, Ghanaian
    scrap workers recover components from computers that would have long since
    been shredded in American recycling facilities. Envisioning Ghana and other
    countries in the “global South” as the victims of technology ignores much
    of the reality of e-waste flow and denies those technicians agency.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Counterstories from “The Strongest Men in Ghana”</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Given the increasing preponderance of evidence that demonstrates countries
    in the “global South” are global players in technological markets and
    effective users, repairers, and recyclers of those technologies, it seems
    likely that the media denial of that agency is explained in part by racism.
    The e-waste export narrative is what Aja Y. Martinez calls a “stock story,”
    a generalized narrative reflecting racial biases encoded in institutional
    practices. Martinez positions the narrative method of “counterstory” as an
    effective means of countering racist dominant narratives (82). She
    explains, “[a]s an interdisciplinary method, CRT [critical race theory]
    counterstory recognizes that the experiential and embodied knowledge of
    people of color is legitimate and critical to understanding racism that is
    often well disguised in the rhetoric of normalized structural values and
    practices” (69). Counterstory, that is, offers an experience that
    challenges the dominant narrative.
</p>
<p>
    For one counterstory to the Agbogbloshie e-waste narrative, consider
Burrell’s <em>Invisible Users: Youth in the Internet Cafes of Urban Ghana</em>, a
    2012 ethnography of the Ghanaian use of electronics. In a chapter on import
    of second-hand computers and the problem of e-waste, Burrell describes a
    scrap dealer named Ibrahim, who works near Agbogbloshie collecting and
    selling computer and car parts to Nigerian and Chinese buyers. Ibrahim
    calls himself “‘the destroyer’” and speaks proudly of his work, describing
    scrap recyclers as “‘the strongest men in Ghana’” (174-5). Far from a
    hapless victim pressured into dangerous work by an exploitative global
    economy, Ibrahim “depicts his entry into the scraps business as a choice he
    made willingly and that offered him an avenue for autonomy and
    self-advancement” (176). Ibrahim’s business started with a $500 investment
    from his mother, who sold a cow to help him; by 2010, he had turned that
    into $5000 in working capital and operated a small taxi business in
    addition to his scrap dealing (175). Though the e-waste “stock story”
    describes burning hunks of wires as low-level, especially dangerous work,
    Ibrahim sees it differently. Burrell explains, “[f]or scraps dealers such
    as Ibrahim, by far the most valuable component of a computer per pound was
    the copper wires that connected circuit boards, the power supply, and the
    ports inside the computer case” (175). Nowhere in Ibrahim’s depiction of
    himself and his work do we see the sad, sick victims of e-waste export that
    populated the <em>Frontline</em> documentary. Instead, e-waste has made him
    a successful businessman, and he in turn employs auto mechanics and other
    repair tradespeople. Agbogbloshie, through Ibrahim’s eyes, is a bustling
    microeconomy.
</p>
<p>
    As another Agbogbloshie counterstory, consider the work of the Pure Earth
    Blacksmith Institute, a non-governmental organization that “devises
    clean-up strategies, empowers local champions and secures support from
    national and international partnerships” (Pure Earth); in Agbogbloshie, the
    organization partnered with two local organizations, the Greater Accra
    Scrap Dealers Association (GASDA) and Green Advocacy Ghana to “promote
    Agbogbloshie as a recycling knowledge centre by setting up a model e-scrap
    facility that protects livelihoods while minimizing the adverse health and
    environment risks of scavenging and exposure to toxic substances” ( “Ghana
    (Agbogbloshie)”). With Blacksmith support, GASDA installed and began
    training Agbogbloshie workers in the use of recycling machines such as
    shredders and wire strippers; these new procedures increased profits of the
    local scrap recyclers, more than enough to fund ongoing maintenance of the
    recycling machines. Other GASDA and Green Advocacy Ghana members worked to
    educate the scrap workers, serving as “human billboards” and distributing
    posters and flyers about the dangers of burning and availability of a
    less-toxic alternative ( “Ghana (Agbogbloshie)”). Why do so many new
    materialist representations of e-waste describe artist-archaeologists and
    so few describe efforts to improve recycling conditions in the scrap yards
    that are held up as the unseemly “end” of the electronics story?
</p>
<p>
    For further counterstory work, Burrell also profiles several shopkeepers in
    Accra selling second-hand electronics. One, Samuel, estimated that of the
    goods brought into the shop, 90% could be sold. Burrell explains:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    He and two other hired technicians worked hard to test, repair, and
    refurbish as many of the computers as they could. They were paid per
    machine and earned money only for what they were able to get working again,
    creating a clear incentive to salvage whatever could possibly be salvaged.
    (171)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
    This notion of creating an obvious financial incentive for repair workers
    to fix what can possibly be fixed seems like a pretty standard business
    management technique: incentivizing repair and disincentivizing scrapping
    leads to a very high rate of reuse and refurbishment. Yet few repair shops
    in the US operate on this model, and almost no manufacturer-authorized
    repair shops do. This refurbishment-incentivizing practice is one way that
    “global North” companies could easily take a cue from the “global South,”
    to move toward more sustainable attitudes towards electronics overall.
</p>
<p>
    A similar argument drives Jerome Denis and David Pontille’s work on
    maintenance and repair; in a 2017 <em>Continent</em> article, they describe
    two “regimes” of attitudes toward maintenance. In the first, which is
    common “in rich countries,” “[m]aterial fragility and the messy side of
    things are meant to remain at the maintenance work perimeter” (13). That
    is, repairers and technicians maintain order; users simply use, and refer
    failing or decaying objects and systems to service professionals. In the
    alternative regime, which is more common in poorer countries but also
    exists in some wealthier countries’ systems such as WiFi infrastructures,
    “the fragility and vulnerability of things are a shared concern. . . . And
    everybody is allowed, and sometimes explicitly invited, to take part in
    repair and maintenance interventions” (14). For an artist-archaeologist
    project that pushes at the boundaries of Western maintenance regimes, we
    might look to German artist Roland Roos’s “Free Repair” project. From 2008
    to 2010, he sought out public examples of broken and defective objects; as
    his website explains, he completed over 100 repair jobs including restoring
    a “supermarket neon sign to its original condition in Zurich, in Lucerne he
    fixed a defective doorbell, in Warsaw he renovated the parking lot markings
    on some cobblestones, which had been disarranged by road works and in
    Berlin he repaired a damaged cupboard, which had been abandoned in the
    street” (Roos). These latter two repairs particularly challenge Western
    maintenance regimes. The parking lot markings had been disturbed by
    official maintenance, and the damaged cupboard was put out as if for
    disposal. Roos’s work asks questions like, “Who is authorized to fix
    things, and why?” Such artistic repairs can function as media archaeology
    counterstory: There are artists working to trace histories of cultural
    objects and challenge their embedded ideologies, without the outdated and
    wealthy-nation-centric implications of the “dead media” narrative.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Beyond Teleology</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I have argued in this essay that new materialists would do well to consider
    narratives of the lives of electronics that are less teleological, less
    myopically focused on consumption in the global North, and more attuned to
    the potentialities of the expertise and perspectives than what Denis and
    Pontille call “maintenance-users”: “[i]n the hand of ‘maintenance-users’
    objects are always changing, living entities that traverse a number of
    intermediate states before being considered as inoperative” (“Beyond
    Breakdown” 16). As a companion to the new materialist search for “zombie
    media”-style “artist-archaeologists,” I intend to call for a hunt for the
    stories of “maintenance-users.”
</p>
<p>
    Drawing on Gabrys, I present this “maintenance-user” approach to
    electronics as “neither utopic nor dystopic,” neither “technophilic” nor
    “technophobic” (12); I certainly do not mean to elide or diminish the very
    real ecological dangers of improperly disposed e-waste, nor to suggest that
    we ought to uncritically celebrate the rapid entry of developing nations
    into the technoverse. A cell phone in the pocket of every Ghanaian—closer
    and closer to reality—is absolutely part of the narrative of technological
    excess, of Western cultural imperialism, of the long fingers of capitalism.
    But the rising tide of technological objects is far beyond the power of new
    materialists to stem, and the global appetite for electronics calls for a
    new approach to e-waste, one that seeks responsible recycling solutions
    along the lines of empowering Agbogbloshie scrap dealers with better
    shredders and empowering Americans to become “maintenance-users.”
</p>
<p>
    To start, perhaps we can stop framing new materialist discussions of
    e-waste with the lens of obsolescence, which artificially marks an end to
    an electronic device’s lifespan, at the abandonment of its first user.
    “Obsolescence” encourages device hoarding, which keeps a huge volume of
    closer-to-new electronics stagnant, off the secondhand market; it inspires
    nostalgia and artistic affect toward the technology of the past. Further,
    “obsolescence” is a socially constructed category, and as the social world
    of electronics markets becomes increasingly global, scholars must ask:
    Obsolete for whom? E-waste is not just “our” problem foisted on “them,”
    where “we” are developed countries and “they” are developing. Every year,
    more and more of the world, developed and developing, global North and
    global South, Western and Eastern, begins to consume technological devices.
    And we—all of us—need better ways of making that consumption sustainable.
