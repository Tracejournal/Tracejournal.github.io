        (Digital) Objects with Thing-Power: A New Materialist Perspective of
        Spaces, Places, and Public Memory
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
        “The story will highlight the extent to which human being and thinghood
        overlap, the extent to which the us and the it slip-slide into each
        other.” - Jane Bennett, <em>Vibrant Matter</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In his argument that maintains the role of artifacts in sociotechnical
    systems, Nathaniel Rivers argues that we cannot study publics without
    taking nonhuman actants into consideration. Rivers states, “It is vital to
    the study of public rhetoric that we attend to the vibrancy of nonhumans as
    they shape collective life […] Publics are emergent; they cannot be traced
    with a narrow, a priori definition of who or what constitutes a public”
    (Rivers, “Tracing”). Rivers’ work, along with others, represent a more
    recent turn in rhetoric and composition/writing studies and related fields
    to study nonhuman influences on the construction of public identities
(Latour; Bogost; Bennett; Barnett and Boyle; Boyle; Gries; Rickert, <em>Ambient Rhetoric</em>). This research has been quite diverse, covering
    everything from the evolution and transformation of the Obama Hope image
    (Gries), to the role of object-oriented ontologies in computer programming
    (Bogost), to more holistic concerns about breaking down the dualism between
    humans and things (Latour). This movement towards considering our deep
    relationality and entanglement with nonhuman things is not simply a concern
    for rhetoric and composition/writing studies either, evidenced in the range
    of scholarship in philosophy, game studies, anthropology, and geography.
    However, it is evident that more and more scholars within RC/WS are turning
    toward posthumanism, new materialism, and vibrancy for their scholarly
    practices. Alongside this nonhuman turn, other scholars, like myself, have
    focused more specifically on the relationship of things, space and place,
    and memory (Jeff Rice; Jones and Greene; Boyle and Jenny Rice). These
    works, while distinct in scope and purpose, share a similar thread that
    examines the relationship between things, space and place, and memory,
    which distinguishes their work from other new materialist rhetorics.
</p>
<p>
    In this article, I examine how a new materialist perspective can strengthen
    how we study public memory and spaces and places. I extend Propen’s
    visual-materialist rhetorical analysis to racialized sites in the American
    South and use a small Southern town as a case study. Pendleton, located in
    the upstate of South Carolina, is a historic, 228-year-old town known for
    its identity of “History – Hospitality – Happenings.” Within the town’s
    limits are two plantation houses, countless other historic structures, and,
    throughout the year, Pendleton hosts various social events in and around
    the town square and the plantation houses. However, in pursuit of its
    identity as a friendly, historic town, it erases or ignores its rich Black
    history and valorizes problematic white events and individuals. In the
    town’s public discourses, evidenced in physical space and places and
    objects like marker texts, memorials, plantation houses, and tourism
    pieces, a hegemonic settler-colonial narrative is depicted that
marginalizes indigenous and Black histories.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Whether via the
    construction of an unwanted memorial in place of a landmark African
    American building, the countless unmarked space and places, or marker texts
    that relay false histories, many of Pendleton’s space and objects invite
    deeper introspection. In this article, I examine how the town’s hegemonic
    narrative is conveyed through new materialist rhetorics and use
    non-discursive objects (memorials, monuments, buildings, as well as spaces
    and places that are not recognized in Pendleton’s public memory) to study
    these relationships. The nonhuman participants within the town’s networked
    discourse are inherently persuasive, and these things disrupt the
narrative by reminding visitors and residents of traces of <em>another</em> history that has been othered.
</p>
<p>
    Along with scholarship in space/place, this article engages with the
    rhetoric of memorials, a growing sub-discipline that has addressed the
    materiality of public memory, as well as the rhetorical influence of
    monuments and memorials in the public sphere. Greg Dickinson, Carole Blair,
    and Brian Ott’s edited collection, <em>Places of Public Memory,</em>
    establishes a relationship between the “rhetorical consequentiality of
    memory.” Similarly, Blair’s “Contemporary U.S. Sites as Exemplars of
    Rhetoric’s Materiality,” crafts an argument that links space, place,
memory, and materiality that Amy Propen takes up later in her book, <em>Locating Visual-Material Rhetorics.</em> In Propen’s text, she argues
    for a joining of visual and material rhetorics in her examination of “the
    mill, the map, and the GPS,” and in doing so, blurs the lines between
    discursive and non-discursive rhetorics, a movement that
    particularly informs my examination of text-based marker texts as well as
    non-discursive memorials and other unmarked memory sites. Dickinson, Ott,
    and Aoki’s article, “Spaces of Remembering and Forgetting,” also
    establishes an important conversation about the misuse of memory sites,
    particularly how these sites function to absolves white Americans from
    their part in settler colonialism. Because I focus exclusively on Southern
    memory sites, I turn to James Chase Sanchez’s and Kristen Moore’s
    “Reappropriating Public Memory,” which uses the vandalism of a Confederate
    monument in Charleston as an exemplar for a larger conversation about the
    rhetoric of racism and Southern memory sites. All together, these
    intersecting threads inform the way the I study the material spaces,
    monuments, and memorials in Pendleton, South Carolina.
</p>
<p>
    According to Laurie Gries, new materialism is “an emergent
    interdisciplinary theory […] part of a nonhuman turn” that challenges
    modernist dualism (4-5). Instead of viewing humans on one side of a sphere
    and things on the other side, new materialism argues for an “ontological
    hybridity” of human and nonhuman actors (5). Likewise, Jane Bennett
    contends that we consider “vibrant materiality” in place of the dualism
    that we usually cling to regarding humans versus nonhumans. Gries writes,
    “I want to highlight what is typically cast in the shadow: the material
    agency of effectivity or nonhuman of not-quite-human things” (ix). This
    article does not argue in favor of a flat ontology or even broach arguments
    about the primacy of nonhuman actants; rather, it refocuses our attention
    on <em>things</em> and attends to the relationship between humans and
    nonhumans. When we study spaces and/or places of public memory, we
    sometimes overlook the persuasiveness of nonhuman actants—which, in the
    case of Pendleton, include a variety of textual examples and non-discursive
    objects like historical markers, a rusty structure, the Pendleton Historic
    Foundation, restaurants, plantation houses, and the Pendleton Foundation
    for Black History and Culture—within the rhetorical ecologies (Edbauer).
    However, the vibrancy of material objects like Keese Barn Memorial, a rusty
metal structure that stands “in memory”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"><sup>2</sup></a> of a booming African
    American store and café, are overlooked in the midst of fall festivals,
    ghost tours, and soirees at Woodburn Historical Home, a plantation house.
These objects, sites, and spaces and places engender Bennett’s notion of <em>thing-power</em>, which is “. . . the curious ability of inanimate
    things to animate, to act, to produce effects dramatic and subtle” (6). I
    seek to highlight the influence and effect of Pendleton’s <em>things</em>&mdash;
    things that make claims to knowledge about what aspects of Pendleton’s
    histories will be remembered and circulated to the public. As Propen
    writes, “[O]ur perception of visual and material artifacts and the
    interpretations that such artifacts help foster can have varied
    consequences not only on our understandings of history but also on our
    individual, lived experiences and for broader societal issues such as
    legislation and policy-making” (xvi). Memory sites not only convey a
    version of history, but they continue to impact the way we relate those
    historical memories to current policies.
</p>
<p>
    In this article, I want to take up this challenge to explore what new
    materialism can do for space and place and memory studies, while using
    Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a method to merge these digital and
    nondigital materialities. I make several moves toward that argument: First,
    I situate Pendleton’s memory problem in terms of how it performs its town
    motto of “History—Hospitality—Happenings.” Secondly, I use Google Maps to
    describe and analyze the space and places and objects in Pendleton that are
    a part of the town’s rhetorical ecology and determine their relationship
    to/with the town’s public narrative. Since these space and places and
    objects are also related to the town’s public memory, I consider the
    contributions of nonhuman participants to the West Side of Pendleton’s
    larger assemblage that includes racial residential lines, traffic and
    welcome signs, a memorial, and other buildings and landscapes. Ultimately,
    I discuss how race, place, and public memory is dramatized in these
    nondiscursive texts and explore future implications for new materialism in
    space/place and public memory research.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Mis/taken Identity</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Pendleton, South Carolina is located in the upstate, sandwiched between the
    Blue Ridge Mountains to the north and the Savannah River Basin to the
    south. A small, rural town, Pendleton was colonized in 1790 after taking
    the land from the Cherokee nation. In what follows, I introduce Pendleton’s
    motto of “History—Hospitality—Happenings” as it relates to historical
    markers, residential segregation, and tourism. While I have chosen to
    separate these areas, they are intrinsically interrelated. For example,
    Pendleton’s “History,” as seen through its historic markers, is also
    representative of “Happenings,” or what events are considered a part of
    public memory.
</p>
<p>
    While there are many ways that historical rhetoric circulates in the public
    sphere, in the American South, one of the most polarizing and influential
    forms is via marker texts. As James Loewen writes, “All across America, the
    landscape suffers from amnesia,” an issue that is
</p>
<p>
    obvious in the way Pendleton remembers its history (4). I purposely use the
singular of <em>history</em> because Pendleton does not relay <em>histories</em> but rather a single <em>history,</em> a history that
    focus on white men. Pendleton supplies a “condensed tour” of the town’s
    origins, the role of slavery in the town’s formation and advancement,
    sharecropping, Jim Crow, and segregation. In fact, the town suffers from
    amnesia, an amnesia that is disseminated to residents and visitors alike.
    At the “historical homes,” Woodburn or Ashtabula, visitors are recounted
    romanticized stories about the lives of the wealthy owners of the estates –
it’s not uncommon, in fact, for people to sigh during tours <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. In an effort to
    reinforce a positive reception from visitors, the Pendleton Historic
    Foundation continues to rehearse stories of wealthy white homeowners, so
    there is little discussion of slavery or of Black history during the tours.
</p>
<p>
    The Deep South is rather famously known for its hospitality—its wide,
    welcoming verandas, and a glass of sweet tea for visitors—and Pendleton,
    South Carolina capitalizes on this rhetoric of hospitality. As previously
    stated, these three areas of Pendleton’s motto are related—Pendleton’s
    sense of hospitality is linked to its history and its happenings. While the
    town <em>appears</em> hospitable via its welcoming Village Green, seasonal
    town festivals and events, and cheery banners, beneath this shiny veneer
    are larger questions about to whom hospitality is extended and to whom it
    is withheld. Specifically, I focus on what David Sibley calls “geographies
    of exclusion” (3), which is a kind of socio-spatial exclusion, via
    residential segregation. Although there are some white residents who live
    on the West Side of Pendleton and some Black residents who live outside the
    West Side, the town is obviously segregated. The majority of people of
    color live north and west of the town square on the west side of Mechanic
Street and the North side of Queen Street <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. White residents spend
    little time on the West Side of Pendleton. The only exception is twice
    daily, when white residents must drive through the West Side of Pendleton
to drop their children off at the local middle school <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. If we consider how
    outdoor public space is used, white residents frequent the Village Green in
    the center of town and Black residents converge beneath Keese Barn Memorial
    (the rusty metal memorial) on the West Side. The borders that I describe
    are borders that are invisible yet unmistakable. There are no explicit laws
    in South Carolina that prevent Black residents from crossing these borders;
    however, areas outside of the West Side of Pendleton are not friendly
    spaces for Black residents. In her essay, “Homeplace: A Site of
    Resistance,” bell hooks compares the fear that she experienced as she
    traveled through the white spaces in town in relation to the sense of
    safety that she felt when she arrived at her grandmother’s home. hooks’s
    description is echoed by West Side residents who describe feeling unwanted,
    unwelcome, and, in some cases, unsafe if they traveled outside the town’s
    “Black boundaries” (Hassan; Gantt).
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the way the town uses its resources further separates white
    and Black residents and the corresponding white and Black spaces. During
    the winter holidays, the Village Green is decorated with lights and other
    festive things; there is also an annual tree-lighting ceremony in the
    center of town. All through the holiday season, a large Christmas tree
    adorns the center of town. It is safe to say that there are no town-wide
    events that are sponsored by the town of Pendleton and located on the West
    Side of town. Similarly, the town recently approved $500,000 improvement
    project (“Town Projects”). These improvements, including new roads,
    sidewalks, and storefronts, are all located in the center of town. None of
    this money has been allocated to improve the aging Pendleton Community
    Center or for the creation of a park near the metal memorial—both located
    on the West Side (“Town Projects;” Hassan; Gantt). Where are the safe and
    unsafe spaces in Pendleton, according to residents who wield
    socio-political power? It’s as simple as observing where the money is
    spent; it is not spent to improve the West Side of Pendleton.
</p>
<p>
    Pendleton’s sense of “Happenings” is interwoven with its History and
Hospitality. According to the town’s website, these happenings <a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"><sup>6</sup></a> include festivals,
    restaurants, shops, churches, and events at Woodburn and Ashtabula. In
    October, the Pendleton Historic Foundation hosts a Ghost Walk where
    individuals can “meet prominent Pendletonians who have gone into the
    beyond” (“Ghost Walk”). Unsurprisingly, when I went on the ghost walk, the
    “prominent Pendletonians” were all wealthy, white individuals—many of them
    slave owners. Likewise, the Pendleton Historic Foundation provides
    plantation house tours, and these homes are also used for agricultural
    events, jazz festivals, and weddings or parties. It’s important to
    understand how the town uses public memory to support a Lost Cause
    ideology, which is a belief that the Confederacy was a just and brave cause
    (Lowndes). It is common for Southern heritage memory sites to use sites
    like plantation homes and memorials to circulate this ideology, and
    Pendleton follows suit alongside larger Southern cities like Savannah,
    Charleston, or Montgomery (Poirot and Watson; Azaryahu and Foote;
    Alderman). While this type of historical representation is common in the
    South, it is nonetheless a racist, hegemonic practice.
</p>
<p>
    Pendleton conveys its version of history with discursive representations
    via historical marker texts, tourism brochures, and walking tours, but much
    of its public memory is evidenced via material artifacts—through a rusty
    art installation/memorial, the geo-spatial arrangement of the town,
    buildings with vibrant yet marginalized histories, and other unmarked sites
    around town. Because these material objects, places, and spaces are not
    accompanied by any explanatory text, I relied on interviews with Pendleton
    residents, as well as archival research, to assemble this narrative.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Non-discursive Public Memory</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Throughout my examination of these material things and sites, I spent quite
    a bit of time walking in and around Pendleton taking photos and capturing
    video footage. This process allowed me to acquaint myself with
    non-discursive objects, places, and spaces that conveyed a sense of the
    town’s public memory. In the following description and analysis, I position
    myself and these material things and sites as an assemblage. Scholars in
    philosophy, rhetoric and writing studies, and cultural geography use the
    term assemblage to identify and explicate disparate yet collective
    groupings, but I want to simply focus on the embodied materiality of my
    research process and the relationship between myself and the nonhuman
    things, places, and spaces in Pendleton (Deleuze and Guattari; Yancey and
    McElroy; Beck; Bennett). The materiality of my body in that space is a part
    of Pendleton’s public memory assemblage, as Bennett argues: “Humanity and
    nonhumanity have always performed an intricate dance with each other. There
    was never a time when human agency was anything other than an interfolding
    network of humanity and
</p>
<p>
    nonhumanity; today this mingling has become harder to ignore” (31). Bennett
    defines an assemblage in several ways, as “an ad hoc grouping of diverse
    elements […] with uneven topographies […] not governed by any central head
    . . . [and] emergent in their ability to make something happen [that is]
    distinct from the sum of the vital force of each materiality considered
    alone” (24). Considered alone, the material artifacts, places, and spaces
    that I analyze are a fraction of the meaning or effect of the totality of
    our assemblage. Each of the following material objects, places, and spaces
    contribute to various publics in Pendleton and while each conveys its own
    value, each is also a part of the town’s various ecologies. Thus,
    assemblage and place have an important relationship, especially as I
    contend that the geospatial arrangement of the town’s nondiscursive things
    present a hegemonic, racist sense of public memory.
</p>
<p>
    The arrangement of these memory objects and sites is rhetorical—there is
    nothing neutral or arbitrary about place (de Certeau; Massey; Dobrin). Sid
    Dobrin writes that the way we use space and place reinforces various forms
    of hegemony (25). Likewise, feminist geographer Doreen Massey focuses on
    the “links and connections” instead of boundaries that prevent us from
    analyzing the relationships between the location of an artifact, the
    surrounding residential areas, and the public memory of a site (5). In
    other words, these assemblages are a part of a larger ecology where borders
    bleed and objects, places, and spaces are interconnected (Edbauer 9, 10).
    To understand how these ecologies operate in Pendleton, I will describe and
    analyze the following artifacts and sites: the intersection of Queen and
    Mechanic streets, the Welcome to the West Side of Pendleton and Do Not
    Enter signs, Keese Barn Memorial, the Pendleton Community Center and nearby
    garbage dump, and Faith Cabin Library.
</p>
<p>
    To help visualize these material objects and sites, as well as their
    proximity to each other, I include a screenshot of Google Maps that I
    created. These maps also function as an example of critical cartography,
    which contends that maps are “. . . rhetorical [and are] always already
    shaping and shaped by the cultural contexts in which [they are] immersed”
    (Propen 6). As part of my place-based research process, I find that mapping
    often allows me to see relationships between spaces and objects that I
    would not be able to see otherwise. Figure 1 is a simplified version of a more detailed map (see Figure 2) that I created that includes
        many more objects and sites, historical walking routes, and place-based
        narratives based on interviews with residents. I begin with this map
        because of its focus on each of the sites/objects; everything else is
        relatively transparent.

<p>
    Towards the right side of the map is a maroon star labeled “Black/White
    Spaces.” This intersection is a juncture of Queen Street (which runs west
    to east) and Mechanic Street (which runs north to south) and represents the
    town’s residential segregation. The majority of people of color live north
    and west of the town square, also known as the West Side of Pendleton.
    Aside from another pocket of African American residences a few miles to the
    east of that intersection,

<p id="figure">Figure 2. Detailed Google Map of various discursive and nondiscursive spaces, places, and objects in Pendleton, South Carolina.</p>
<p>
    African Americans have lived in this space since the mid-to-late 1800s.
    There are distinct spaces and places that are “meant” for Black residents;
    this is common knowledge to African Americans, according to several Black
    residents that I interviewed. One interviewee mentioned that as a child in
    the 1950s and 1960s, she and a friend would sit on a bench on the Village
    Green (the center of town and a space not historically welcome to Black
    residents) just so people driving through town could see that Black people
    lived in Pendleton (Hassan; Gantt; Garrison; Peppers).

<p><img src="img/03-obrien.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 3. Black/White Spaces: The intersection of Queen Street and Mechanic Street in Pendleton, SC. Photo by the author.</p>
<p>
    To the north of the intersection, which is seen on the right side of the
    image, Mechanic Street traverses out of Pendleton. The left side of the
    image is West Queen Street, which leads to the West Side of Pendleton. All
    sidewalks and streetlights end within 100 yards on West Queen Street. There
    is also one business on West Queen Street, but to the south and east is the
    Village Green, a space with a large park, and restaurants and shops that
    line this rectangular space. It is this region that benefitted from the
    $750,000 beautification project, not the West Side of town.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike some of the more apparent examples of Pendleton’s visual-material
    public memory, this intersection is almost invisible to bystanders and even
    many residents. And while the street signs contain text, this space is
    nonetheless a nondiscursive one. It is also a part of an assemblage that
    includes the other sites and places that I analyze; studied as a lone
    space, it is almost void of meaning. However, when studied in conjunction
    with these other spaces and places, it becomes a symbol for Pendleton’s
    implicit and explicit racism. The intersection is the dividing line. It is
    a rhetorical and geographic space that makes claims to knowledge about
    Pendleton’s longstanding issue with segregation and racism.

<p>
    Referring back to the map in Figure 1, the next two geographical points are
    west of the “Black/White Spaces” maroon star. These points on the map are
    two signs: the “Welcome to the West Side of Pendleton” and the “Do Not
    Enter” road sign. At the center of the divided road is a sign—Welcome to
    the West Side of Pendleton. On the sign is the colorful image of a
    butterfly, as well as a general welcome and a quote, “A Village of
    Vision – A Community of Promise.” Prior the sign’s erection, the area of
    West Queen Street and its side streets were historically considered the
    “West Side” of town, but in a vague, amorphous way (Hassan; McCall). Prior
    to the erection of the welcome sign, white residents in Pendleton referred
    to the West Side in imprecise and separatist terms like “over there” or
    “the other part of town.” (Hassan). Although African Americans have resided
    in the West Side for 150 years or more, it wasn’t until 2013 that the West
    Side of Pendleton became an officially designated town space. The Pendleton
    Community Center partnered with the United Way to beautify the West Side in
    2013. The $2500 grant funded the creation of the sign and the flower bed,
    although the flower bed has not been consistently maintained (Hassan). The
    town is over 228 years old, but it was not until 2013 that the space and
    places where Black residents live was officially recognized. And this
    recognition only occurred as a result of the Pendleton Community Center’s
    efforts (the PCC is a historical community activist nonprofit organization
    that is located on the West Side with primarily African American
    residents). While the notion of “A Village of Vision – a Community of
    Promise” appears hopeful, the words lack resonance when viewed within the
    scope of the town’s lethargic movements towards dealing with segregation,
    unequal distribution of grant money, as well as its white-centric version
    of public memory.
</p>
<p>
    The butterfly on the sign, a symbol of growth and evolution, is
    strategically placed on the sign, but there is no metamorphosis evident on
    Pendleton’s West Side. The flower bed in front of the sign remains
    unplanted for much of the year. There is almost no evidence of commerce,
    and residences that line West Queen Street are dilapidated. Some homes have
    tarped roofs, and others have missing or boarded windows. While the town
    received a sizable grant of $500,000 to improve the streetscape around the
    Village Green (which they matched an addition $250,000 to bring the grand
    total to $750,000), none of that money was earmarked for the West Side of
    Pendleton (“Town Projects”; Hassan; Gantt). In July 2017, the town council
    also approved a Façade Improvement Grant Project for businesses along the
    town’s Corridor Overlay District and Town Square Overlay District. Three
    buildings were awarded each $2000, but none were located on the West Side
    of town (“Press Release”). Just above and to the left of the sign is
    traffic sign that reads “Do Not Enter.” Since this section of West Queen
    Street divides, the Do Not Enter is meant to inform westbound drivers to
    use the right side of road. Left of the sign is another road for eastbound
    drivers.
</p>
<p>
    As with the “Black/White Spaces” waypoint, these two points on the map are
    technically discursive. It’s true that the text on the welcome sign is
    dissonant when studied in tandem with the surrounding material spaces, the
    lived experiences of Pendleton’s Black residents, and the town’s racist
    history that is repeatedly hidden from public memory. Even more evocative,
    though, are these two sign’s geospatial and material affect. They are
    located to provide entrance/introduction to a historically Black region,
    but when examined as part of an
</p>
<p>
    assemblage, the welcome sign and the Do Not Enter traffic sign, located
    just west of the Black/White intersection, collectively illustrate
    residential segregation. The welcome sign and Do Not Enter sign
    simultaneously invite the visitor/resident to subvert the rules and enter
    the spaces as well as to warn the visitor/resident from settling too long
    on the West Side of Pendleton. Viewed as part of an assemblage, the signs
    evoke an affect derived in part from their geographical location (west of
    the Black/White intersection) and also from their thing-power. Thing-power,
    according to Jane Bennett is, “. . . [the] curious ability of inanimate
    objects to animate, to act, to product effects dramatic and subtle” (6).
    It’s impossible to ignore the Do Not Enter sign, especially because of its
    placement directly behind the welcome sign. The sign instills a sense of
    fear and foreboding; it does not invite us to come any closer.

<p>
    The next geospatial point on the map in Figure 1 is Keese Barn Memorial,
    which is located about 50 yards from the welcome sign on West Queen Street.
    The rusty metal memorial was once where Keese Barn stood, a significant
    place for African American history in Pendleton, as well for as the region.
    In 1910, Benjamin Keese, an African American businessman, opened Keese Barn
    as an antique store and café. For forty years or so, the space served as a
    community meeting point. It was the first public place where black
    residents could eat. During these years, black Pendletonians could not go
    to the drugstore soda fountain and get a drink, so Keese Barn served a
    social and economic purpose for the West Side of town. The store and café
    closed, and the building fell into disrepair. In the mid-1970s, the
    Pendleton Foundation for Black History and Culture bought the building for
    the purpose of turning it into a Black History and Cultural Center (Hassan;
    Gannt; McCall). The Foundation desired to remember Pendleton’s black
    history in a town where only white history was (and is) celebrated. They
    tried to raise the money or find grants for close to 25 years before the
    town made a deal with the Clemson University Architecture program, who tore
    down the building and built the rusty metal memorial in its place in 2002.
    The project was spearheaded by two Clemson graduate students and their
    supervising professor for the purpose of “. . . bringing great
    understanding of the concept of ‘south’ as a mode of inquiry into place,
    culture, and territory” as well as to “reinvest the Keese Barn site with
    the meaning it held for the community” (“Keese Barn Project”). While the
    structure was purported to engage <em>with the community</em> to identify
    the role of place and architecture in small towns, residents describe
    little communication between the university and community during the
    planning stages. Many explain that they were deceived about the appearance
    and purpose of the memorial; residents were told that the structure would
    include walls that could house various historical artifacts from Keese’s
    store (Hassan; Harrison; Gantt). Since its erection in 2002, Keese Barn
    Memorial has been loathed by residents on the West Side of town, and most
    stinging to residents is the fact that the professor who was responsible
    for the establishment of the rusty structure and the stone monuments was
    African American (Hassan).
</p>
<p>
    The metal structure cannot offer protection from the elements, and it
    certainly does not benefit the local economy. Since the structure was
    built, many residents still use the space as a meeting-place; plastic and
    foldable lawn chairs stand in rows along the structure. Nearby is a
    dart-board that has been nailed to one of the metal posts, as well as a
    meat smoker and grill. One elderly gentleman explained, while gesturing to
    the nearby chairs, “We have asked the town to give us a park here. They
    said they would work on it, but nothing has happened. We just want a park
    here like you all have down there,” he said, pointing a half-mile down the
    road to the Village Green, a greenspace in the center of Pendleton where
    restaurants and shops line the perimeter and where town-wide events are
    held.
</p>
<p>
    Keese Barn Memorial wields significant rhetorical impact as a material
    artifact, including its geospatial configuration on the West Side of
    Pendleton. For those who do not live on the West Side and drive past the
    memorial, it is a rusty oddity—an eyesore in an already blighted community.
    For West Side residents, it is a travesty and a symbol of white
    colonization. When read within the West Side assemblage, it materially
    demonstrates largescale social issues that simmer beneath this historic
    town’s version of antebellum public memory: Black voices in Pendleton are
    not heard, Black history in Pendleton has been erased from public memory,
    and segregation persists along the lines of Queen Street and Mechanic
    Street.

<p>
    The final three waypoints are about a quarter of a mile west on Queen
    Street from Keese Barn Memorial (see Figure 1) and include Pendleton
    Community Center (PCC), Faith Cabin Library (FCL), and a garbage dump. The
    three sites all exist on the same property; PCC is closest to Queen Street,
    FCL is about 20 yards to the west of PCC, and the garbage dump is behind
    both PCC and FCL. Out of the three sites, FCL is the oldest. While this
    building is slightly better recognized by the town, FCL does not enjoy the
    same financial attention or tourism as Woodburn or Ashtabula, the town’s
    plantation houses. The library was built in 1936 by Willie Lee Buffington,
    a white mill worker, who later became a minister and college professor.
    Because of segregation laws in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and the first half
    of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, African Americans were not allowed to use
    public libraries, so FCL provided library services to Black residents in
    Pendleton, as well as the nearby rural communities in Pickens and Anderson
    County (Hassan; Harrison). This Faith Cabin Library is significant because
    it is “. . . one of only two remaining free-standing Faith Cabin Libraries
    extant of the thirty built in South Carolina between 1932 and 1943” (“South
    Carolina”). In spite of the Library’s undeniable historical impact in
    Pendleton, it is not a part of any historical tours and does not have its
    own historical marker. There is, however, a passing reference to FCL on a
    historical marker, but there is no depth to this discussion. As a result,
    residents and tourists do not realize the significance of this building,
    and its memory continues to fade from public memory. FCL is in rough shape
    as well, and a local nonprofit organization, Pendleton Foundation for Black
    History and Culture (PFBHC) recently saved money to repair the metal roof
    and drew from local labor to make these improvements. It’s noteworthy that
    the town council did not play a role in these improvements, nor did the
    Pendleton Historic Foundation, and no portion of the $750,000 used to
    beautify the town square was used for even basic repairs towards FCL
    (Hassan; Harrison).
</p>
<p>
    To someone driving by the Pendleton Community Center (PCC), it appears like
    another dilapidated building on the West Side of Pendleton. Its white paint
    is peeling in places, and the roof is worn. Located on the same property as
    FCL, as well as a playground and basketball court, this building is easily
    overlooked. While some of the other spaces in Pendleton receive even a
    passing mention on the historical marker text nearby, there is nothing
    about PCC. I assumed—as I’m sure many do—that it used to be a space for
    people to congregate for meetings and events but is not used anymore due to
    its physical appearance. However, the Center is another forgotten space in
    Pendleton, and again, its significance to/within the Black community is not
    publicly circulated.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout the years, the Center has served the community in a variety of
    ways. First, it is not just a building, but a nonprofit organization
    dedicated to civil rights and creating a safe space for the youth. Once
    federally mandated integration finally changed the educational environment
    in Pendleton, Riverside (a local all-Black school) and other schools became
    integrated. This was not an easy transition in Pendleton or elsewhere, so
    there were frequent issues between students and between Black students and
    faculty as well (Peppers; Hassan; Harrison). The PCC acted as a liaison
    between the community and the school; if there were incidents where Black
    students experienced racist overtones or treatment, the PCC would step in
    and meet with school officials. It was not uncommon for parents to look to
    the PCC board to fight their battles, and as a result, parents felt like
    they had a voice during a time of tumultuous transition. Board members like
    Robert Henry Thompson and Albert Gantt were vocal participants in school
    board meetings and “were a force to be reckoned with” (Garrison). It was
    commonly known that if there were “racial problems” at school, that parents
    could call the PCC to intervene; therefore, the PCC existed as a local
    chapter of the NAACP (Garrison). Along the same lines, the PCC served an
    educational function for young people on the West Side of Pendleton.
    Throughout the summer, there were summer programs so that children could
    enjoy recreation, reinforce skills at school, as well as receive free
    breakfast and lunch. Parents knew that their kids were safe at the PCC, and
    children grew up among their friends during the summer months (Peppers). In
    many of my interviews with residents, they cite their summer years at the
    PCC as some of the most formative in their life.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of the PCC continuing to fall into disrepair, the board members are
    actively trying to keep the building in work order. Others in the town,
    like Don Peppers, have created summer programs similar to the ones that he
    attended as a child. Camp Proverbs and Camp Essence, respectively for young
    men and young women, provide breakfast and lunch for kids, character
    training, along with football and basketball time. Peppers, along with the
    PCC, wants to see the space again used to improve the community, but
    because of a lack of finances, both Peppers and the PCC struggle to stay
    afloat. While a nonprofit organization, if the town at large valued spaces
    like this and the history represented therein, there would be options for
    members. At the very least, the PCC should be a part of the town’s
    historical narrative (Peppers).
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the 1970s, the area behind the PCC was used as a garbage dump for
    the town. Dump trucks drove right up and several times a week, dumped the
    town’s refuse right on the West Side of Pendleton. During this time, the
    PCC was used as a trade school, as well as a summer program for area
    children. The odor was overwhelming at times, especially during the hot
    summer months from May-October. After many years of protesting this
    injustice, the town finally agreed to move the dump. However, instead of a
    proper waste removal, they covered it with grass and transformed the dump
    into a sports field for the West Side (Hassan; Harrison). Currently,
    neighborhood kids that play on those fields are actually playing on top of
    a garbage dump. The garbage dump – and its remnants – is a material
    representation of the town’s explicit and implicit racism, as well as how
    little value Pendleton has historically placed on the West Side. Especially
    when I consider the significance of the PCC as a local branch of the NAACP
    or the fact that Black children played steps away from the area—it is
    obvious how little Pendleton’s leaders have valued its Black spaces and
    places. Sanchez and Moore write that “. . . public memory forms (and
    constantly reforms) through material and rhetorical means,” but the
    opposite can be said as well. In the American South, public memory is
    carefully curated to convey nostalgia for the antebellum era. As a result,
    in small towns like Pendleton, public memory of racism, slavery, and Jim
    Crow is actually erased. Moreover, sites like PCC are unlikely to become a
    part of the town’s public memory because in illuminating the town’s civil
    rights leaders, it would also amplify the town’s persistent racism.
</p>
<p>
    When analyzed in conjunction with the other geospatial sites on the map,
    the rhetorical impact of these three sites is heightened. As individual
    places, objects, and sites, each is meaningful and illustrates Pendleton’s
    memory problem. But as part of the larger assemblage, including the lines
    of racial segregation along Queen/Mechanic, the Welcome and Do Not Enter
    signs, and Keese Barn Memorial, a narrative begins to unfold about how
    race, place, and public memory is dramatized in these nondiscursive texts.
    Amy Propen writes:
</p>
<p>
    To understand visual-material artifacts as rhetorical means exploring not
    only their individual graphical, physical, or textual components but also
    their combined, broader consequences on the rhetorical situation and the
    bodies implicated within those settings. It requires examining not only the
    rhetorical responses to visual-material artifacts but how those responses
    are shaped by […] objects. (186)
</p>
<p>
    The fact that a garbage dump existed behind the PCC until the 1970s is
    impactful enough, but it is even more relevant when viewed within the lens
    of the town’s Black/White spaces or of the origins of Keese Barn and the
    “memorial” that now stands in the center of the West Side. Pendleton’s
    larger narrative is one of enduring racism and a public memory tainted by
    white supremacist politics.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>
    While some rhetorical scholars have explored the relationship between race,
    place, and memory (Blair; Sanchez and Moore; Tell), others have focused
    more on the role of objects and things via
</p>
<p>
    new materialism and visual-material rhetorics (Gries; Propen). This article
    seeks to bring these two perspectives into conversation and to examine how
    a new materialist perspective can strengthen how we study spaces, places,
    and objects that convey public memory. I use Google Maps, a simplified form
    of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a method to merge these digital
    and nondigital materialities and to help visualize the sites and objects
    that I analyzed.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
    Through my discussion of geospatial points on the maps, I was able to
    describe and analyze the space and places and objects in Pendleton that are
    a part of the town’s rhetorical ecology and determine their relationship
    to/with the town’s public memory. Viewed as individual sites or objects,
    each waypoint illustrated a problematic application of Pendleton’s town
    slogan “History—Hospitality—Happenings”. However, when examined as part of
    a collective assemblage, each waypoint contributes to the one another and
    becomes a part of a larger narrative. This narrative is one that is
    reflected around the American South, where Black and white bodies are
    residentially segregated, where resources are not equally distributed in
    communities, and where Black histories are either erased or minimized in
    favor of nostalgia for the antebellum South. This study represents just a
    portion of spaces, places, and objects in Pendleton, and much more can be
    said about the relationship between race, place, and memory and new
    materialism. These areas of study are complementary, especially when we
    analyze nondiscursive sites and objects like memorials, historical sites,
    or other places of public memory.

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
    <p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">1</a> An example of this settler-colonial narrative is seen on the town’s official marker that is located on the Village Green, which is Pendleton’s center of commerce and social activity.
    The marker speaks of the Scotch-Irish settlers buying the land in the late 18th century with only a passing
    reference to the Cherokee Indians who lived in these s/places prior to the arrival of the Scotch-Irish colonists.</p>
    <p><a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2">2</a> I use scare quotes in reference to “in memory” because the memorial
