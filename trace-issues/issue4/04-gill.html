<h2><strong>How to (News)feed a Crowd: Transformation and Collaboration in Digital Food Communities</strong></h2>
<h3>Kelli R. Gill</h3>
<h4>Texas Christian University</h4>

<h4 style="text-align: right;">(<em>Published February xx, 2020</em>)</h4>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
    In his essay “Citizenship, Rhetoric, and Pedagogy,” Gerard A. Hauser
    discusses the need for individuals to interact face-to-face with strangers
    in order to establish trust. He argues that these types of relationships
    are in decline because of the disappearance of structures of secondary
    associations like churches or volunteer groups (132-133). He contends that
    while digital communities may be powerful and allow for widespread
    networking, they are no substitute for face-to-face contact. Instead of
    interaction among individuals of difference, he argues, online spaces tend
    to create collections of only like-minded people. This phenomenon is known
    as the “echo chamber” (Colleoni et al 319). The risk of echo chambers is
    not just that online spaces, especially social media, create enclosed
    communities with similar viewpoints, but that these polarized communities
    lead to radical opinions (Warner 431) and conflict (Hahn et al. 70). While
    it’s fair to say that social media can create echo chambers, this criticism
    is most often in regard to political content (Dubois and Blank, Colleoni et
    al., Karlsen et al.). Indeed, most work on the polarization of online
    communities has been focused on political discussions of fake news (Ross
    and Rivers, Farkas et al., Skinnell), political discourse on social media
    (Pond and Lewis, Brundidge), and protests (Rice, Olson, Tufekci and Wilson,
    Bastos et al). While this work has become increasingly significant since
    the US 2016 election, it’s important to ask whether polarization and
    radicalization are rampant across the internet or just around certain
    content and communities. To return to Hauser’s essay, can the internet act
    as a structure of secondary associations? If so, what potential digital
    content creates opportunities for this interaction?
</p>
<p>
    We, scholars of digital rhetoric, should turn our attention to the
    circulation of seemingly neutral digital artifacts. One study by the Pew
    Research Center found that polarized crowds are often formed around
    political content, but that other topics (hashtags) such as hobbies or
    brands, reveal less polarized communities (Smith et al., “<a href="https://www.pewinternet.org/2014/02/20/mapping-twitter-topic-networks-from-polarized-crowds-to-community-clusters/">Mapping Twitter Topic Networks</a>”). There’s great potential for individuals to encounter difference and
    interact with strangers around less divisive content. Hauser argues that
    individuals establish trust among strangers in bowling alleys or
    churches—not political rallies. The space and medium plays a huge part in
    the way individuals interact. This is not to argue that we should turn away
    from content which is political (thus divisive), but rather that we should
    not assume that meaningful rhetorical action can only occur around
    “serious” content. Similarly, if we want to consider the ways that the
    internet can act as a structure of secondary associations, we should
    consider looking at content which reflects other types of interactions and
    components of identity.
</p>
<p>
    Individual identity is composed of far more than political affiliation and
users make meaning through digital content of all types.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Within this article, I
    will build upon previous research in digital communities and participatory
    culture (Arroyo; Reid; Hodgson; Jenkins; Papacharissi) and the call for
    rhetoric and composition scholars to look to mundane, everyday writing
    practices (DeLuca; Gogan; Rivers and Weber; Weisser; Bacha) to explore how
    strangers connect with one another through digital recipes. Digital recipes
    offer content which appears neutral to users (thus less likely to create
    polarizing political responses) but creates opportunity for connection and
    trust. Through analysis of user interaction in the comment sections of
    digital recipes, this article demonstrates the potential of social media to
    act as a structure of secondary associations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Communities/Comments of Digital Recipes</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To narrow the focus of this article, I will be looking at digital recipes
created by <em>Tasty</em>, a prevalent food blog. I’ve chosen to look at <em>Tasty</em> because they have popularized a very unique style of digital
    recipes which are video only and utilize what Katharina Rein and Tommaso
    Venturini call a “social-only content dissemination strategy” (3369).
    Companies like <em>Tasty</em> use social media sites for their content
    distribution in order to take advantage of Facebook algorithms which
    prioritize videos uploaded directly to the platform in user’s newsfeeds
    over other content like photos, links, or texts (Tandoc and Maitra 1680).
    When I first began this project in 2016, <em>Tasty</em>’s Facebook page had
    around seventy-six million likes; as I’m writing this today (2020) they
    have over ninety-seven million. One study which analyzed one-hundred
    million Facebook videos found that food videos had the most engagement from
    users, with <em>Tasty</em> being noted as one of the most popular pages
    (Rayson). The high interaction on these videos (with many garnering
    thousands of comments and likes and million plus shares) make them a rich
    site for research. The widespread reach of these videos also increases the
    potential for millions of users to come into contact with each other
    through the comment section. Comment threads in particular demonstrate how
    users interact <em>with</em> each other around a single video, rather than
    as two polarized groups. By examining the language used within comments, we
    can see how individuals encounter difference. Within this article I will be
    doing some close readings of user comments in order to talk about the ways
    digital recipes open dialogue about identity, ownership, and authenticity.
</p>
<p>
    Facebook comments matter, not just to users but to rhetoricians. Whereas
    comment sections within online newspapers (generally political content)
    have been widely researched (Canter, Coe et al., Hughey et al., Morlandsto
    &amp; Mathisen, Rosenberry, Ruiz et al., Santana, Urper et al.), less
    analysis has been done on the comment sections of social media content.
    Comments deserve further attention from a rhetorical perspective because of
    the ways they demonstrate user composing and communication practices. As
    John R. Gallagher notes, “Investigating online comments can deepen our
    understanding of the way audience interactivity emphasizes production and
    distribution as overlapping and intersecting processes” (34). Comments
    challenge what it means to create and consume by opening digital content to
    potentially unintended rhetorical action. While recipes might traditionally
    be assumed to be instructional and lead to cooking or eating—a digital
    recipe has the potential to reach multitudes of unintended audiences which
    can provide context and challenges to the video through commenting. By
    providing close readings of different comment threads, I hope to
    demonstrate the ways that users form communities through video consumption.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Food as Communication</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Roland Barthes argued that food acts as “a system of communication, a body
    of images, a protocol of usages, situations, and behavior” (29). Food is
    social and cultural; as a system of communication, food is simultaneously
    being shaped by the environment and group of people it is made by and
    shaping the values and behaviors of that society. As an important
meaning-making practice, food enables us to communicate our values <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"><sup>2</sup></a> while also stimulating
    conversations while eating and cooking. Studying food and other common
    objects from a rhetorical perspective allows us to define an object’s value
    outside of its physical function. Just as food is more than mere fuel for
    the body, food videos are more than just cooking or just instruction.
</p>
<p>
    The popularity of digital recipes like <em>Tasty</em> indicates the
    rhetorical function of food, because it solicits consumption of content in
    addition to consumption of the food itself. Patrizia Calefato argues that,
    “Our fascination with food is specific to postmodern society and can be
    seen through our devotion to food media, trends, and movements. Everyone,
    everywhere, all the time is constantly talking about food, eating food, or
    making food” (371). The rise of the internet has also led to a rise in
    recipe sharing, cooking videos, and food photography. The practice of
    taking pictures of our meals and sharing them online demonstrates how much
    food is tied to communication—to the extent that mere pictures of our food
    are supposed to communicate something <em>about us</em>, in a way that text
    alone cannot. Additionally, the visual composition of the food image
    becomes just as important as the physical composition of the food itself.
</p>
<p>
    Our fascination with food is entangled with technology, and digital recipes
    demonstrate one way in which food acts as a form of communication. As
    sociologist Alice P. Julier points out, “meals provide a landscape from
    which to explore all manners of cultural and economic dilemmas. Decisions
    about whom to eat with, in what manner, and what kinds of food are
    inextricably tied to social boundaries” (2). What might appear to be a
    simple action such as deciding on what to eat for dinner is a negotiation
    between social values, cultural identities, health choices, and material
    access. Digital recipes extend those negotiations further by placing them
    in public, social spaces. Food choices are no longer just about what to
    cook or eat, but also about what food content a user consumes and engages
    with. As noted previously, the digital content highly influences the type
    of conversations which take place around and about it. An online video
    isn’t just a recipe or just moving images, but rather it tells stories.
    When these stories align or misalign with the “protocol of usages,
    situations, and behavior,” or break “social boundaries” users are quick to
    respond and debate with one another (which I’ll demonstrate in the close
    readings below). The digital recipe is categorized not just by its content
    but by the perception and understanding of the user. Just as Julier points
    out that meals are a site in which scholars can explore social and culture
    issues, so too do digital recipes offer a landscape in which we can
    understand the material and immaterial user consumption.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Online Counterparts: Assessing Digital Artifacts</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When a traditional recipe (such as those found in cookbooks) transitions to
    a digital platform, it can take on different forms. Though the recipe may
    contain the same instructions as a previous, text-only version, the content
    creator utilizes technology to communicate with his or her audience.
    Elizabeth Fleitz explains that, “Modifications, deletions, substitutions
    and experiments enable the cook to reproduce the text in her own way.
    Digital versions of the traditional recipe take advantage of its dynamic
    nature, enhancing the recipe with hyperlinks, photos, videos, and user
    comments” (“Cooking Codes”). Digital recipes from <em>Tasty</em>
    demonstrate this transition drastically.
</p>
<p>
    Whereas text-based recipes often offer specific instructions such as
    methods (cut, whip, beat, fry), quantities, and notations, <em>Tasty</em>’s
    digital recipes utilize very little text and no verbal instructions. Users
    are forced to direct their attention to actions within the video to model
the recipe, rather than reading over a text for clarification. <em>Tasty </em>even changes the genre of a food video (Basu). While most
food videography features a cook providing instruction or commentary, <em>Tasty</em> videos are faceless and feature only aerial shots of hands
    and food<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"><sup>3</sup></a> as shown in
    Figure 1 below.
</p>
<p><img src="img/01-gill.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 1. Text.</p>
<p>
    Visually this style not only removes the author (thus rhetorically
    eliminating the traditional authority of a chef or celebrity cook) but also
    creates a first-person perspective, causing the user to imagine they are
    the ones preparing the dish. Whereas a traditional recipe writes to a
    reader with an aim for them to cook (either in an attempt to persuade a
    reader to make the dish or under the assumption they are already in the
    act), a <em>Tasty</em> recipe invites the user to act as a participant in
    the process. This method is drastically different than more traditional
    videos like those presented on cooking channels or food vlogs. Whereas most
forms of food media often utilize the face or voice of a cook to <em>invite</em> viewers into their kitchen spaces like a close friend
    (consider the popularity of cooking shows like <em>The Pioneer Woman</em>
    or <em>The Barefoot Contessa</em> which take place in the chef’s homes
    often showing the host’s family or intimate domestic tasks like setting the
    table or walking through their pantry), <em>Tasty</em> makes no effort to
    create an environment in which the user feels like a guest. Rather the
    video has users take on the role of cook themselves, in many ways implying
    that they <em>are</em> making the dish at that very moment. The
    participatory nature of <em>Tasty</em> videos as well as the communicative
    properties of food makes Tasty videos inviting for users to take ownership
    of such recipes. Success for a traditional recipe may mean that a reader
    cooks the dish, but for digital recipes the goal may not be to cook at all.
    Digital recipes challenge our understanding of materiality by changing what
    it means to <em>consume</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Redefining Consumption</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Recognizing the rhetorical function of digital recipes requires that we
    redefine consumption as a digital practice, Anna Lavis suggests that we
    must
</p>
<p>
    go beyond a paradigm of eating only as something that happens in encounters
    with the materiality of mouths and stomachs; rather, it takes place in, and
    assembles together, brains, eyes and computer screens. Such remapped
    vectors of a dematerialized digestive system demonstrate eating food porn
    to be simultaneously disembodied and yet embodied. (4)
</p>
<p>
    Lavis’s discussion of food porn applies well to the digital recipe, as it
    reframes consumption as complicated, disembodied, and embodied. Rather than
    reducing digital food artifacts to an either/or scenario (either it
    functions the same as material food <em>or</em> it is not valuable), Lavis
    resists online/offline binaries and emphasizes the networked encounters
    between bodies, computer screens, and food media. Digital recipes or “food
    porn” motivate users to act through consumption of the media itself. The
    recipes create opportunities for different responses. While the concept of
    digital consumption could be construed as simply “watching a video,” this
    reduction ignores the potential for embodied processes such as becoming
    hungry, salivating, feeling desire, deciding to cook, or eating.
    Additionally, these embodied responses can also overlap with immaterial
    responses such as imagining, changes in perspective, recall of memories,
    thoughts of the future, or even emotional responses such as anger or joy.
    The invitation to look, imagine, and interact with content can be defined
    as rhetorical action. Falling back on user engagement as watching only
    ignores the participatory nature of the video—the “interactivity” of the
    user which “emphasizes production and distribution” (Gallagher 34). It is
    the multitude of potential interpretations and responses that creates the
    potential for digital recipes to bring about interactions among strangers.
</p>
<p>
    The study of these interactions allows us to see not just the persuasion of
    the video to “take action” but also what James P. Zappen calls,
    “self-expression for the purpose of exploring individual and group
    identities” (322). As a system of communication, food becomes a way in
    which individuals can explore social and cultural issues together. By
    challenging the authenticity or methods of a recipe they are not just
    critiquing a video, but are also arguing “This dish belongs to me… my family… my culture.” This form of self-expression demonstrates how food acts as a “protocol of
    usages, situations, and behavior” (Barthes 29). While food appears neutral,
    the close readings in the following passages will demonstrate the nuanced,
    powerful ways which users express themselves through food. Further, these
    discussions show how commenting on digital recipes allows users to
    encounter difference in a productive way.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Identification through Food</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Simona Stano, in “Lost in Translation: Food, Identity, and Otherness,”
    argues that we must “…investigate the links existing between the signs,
    texts, discourses, and practices concerning the food universe, on the one
    hand, and the processes of construction and the forms of expression of
    sociocultural identity&mdash;or, better, identities&mdash;on the other hand” (82).
    This investigation requires that we begin truly looking at digital recipes,
not just as another food media but as a new food practice of <em>identification</em>. The formation of food identities draws on both
    physical practices and immaterial processes. An investigation of the links
    between these practices shows that digital food artifacts are interpreted
    by and recirculated through a user’s culture. The interaction among users
    in digital food communities can demonstrate the ways users take up and
    negotiate identities through food. An example of the way that digital food
    artifacts are interpreted by and recirculated through a user’s culture is
seen in the comment sections of digital recipes.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In a <em>Tasty </em>
    recipe for Chicken Tagine, a traditional Moroccan dish—many users display
    cultural expressions of identification when commenting on the recipe shown
    in Figure 2.
</p>
<p>
    Though the video does reference Morocco it does not claim the dish as
    authentically Moroccan. Both User A and User B identify themselves as
    Moroccan and begin to question the authenticity of the recipe. By framing
    the recipe in terms of the interaction among users rather than the content
    itself—we can see how the dish functions as a representation of Moroccan
    identity and a display of textual authority.
</p>
<p><img src="img/02-gill.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 2. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty/videos/1891859034161418/">Chicken Tagine</a>. User names are public, but have been blocked here for privacy.</p>

<p>
    User A states, “Thanks for bringing awareness to how delicious the subtle,
    delicate Moroccan cuisine is, but please learn about it before posting
    recipes like this one.” User A’s attention to awareness recognizes that
    Moroccan cuisine is not adequately represented in cooking literature (as
    the act of <em>bringing</em> awareness would not be necessary in a widely
    recognized, dominant dish). Second though, is User A’s request that the
    video producers “learn” about the culture before posting recipes. User A’s
    statements create a digital story that references a history of lack of
    representation and misinterpretation. Nick Couldry explains that, “digital
    storytelling in principle represents a correction of those latter hidden
    injuries since it provides the means to distribute more widely the capacity
    to tell important stories about oneself – to represent oneself as a social,
    and therefore potentially political, agent – in a way that is registered in
    the public domain” (386). Here, User A is both recognizing and correcting a
cultural injury by representing Moroccan culture and reclaiming the dish.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"><sup>5</sup></a>
    User A’s claims demonstrate the way food is defined through cultural
    context. User A claims authority over the dish by identifying it as part of
    Moroccan culture, then publicly calls <em>Tasty</em> out for appropriating
    a food before understanding its history. According to User A, the dish
    cannot be called Moroccan because the content creator is not demonstrating
    knowledge or understanding of Moroccan cooking. Eating becomes seen as “not
    simply a natural act” but as “culturally constructed” (De Solier 16). De
    Solier’s claim that food is culturally constructed fits with Barthes’s
    understanding of food as a system of communication—one which is situated
    culturally and must be performed according to a set of protocols.
</p>
<p>
    User B also identifies themselves as Moroccan but draws attention to method
    as an indicator of authenticity. User B states, “First. You don’t bake
    Moroccan Tagin. Second. You don’t fry/cook any ingredients before you put
    in the Tagine. Hope to see another post with proper method of cooking
    Moroccan Tagin.” User B recognizes the practice of physical cooking methods
    as tied to cultural practices. Stano argues that food “concerns all the
    various activities, discourses, and images that surround and are associated
    with it, therefore becoming a form of expression of cultural identity”
    (96). User B is establishing that this particular food is associated with
    certain methods and practices—these associations determine its
    authenticity, not the name or ingredients alone. User B assumes that the
    dish <em>should</em> be authentic, and that to be authentic it must follow
    certain methods. User B engages with the video content but does not agree
    with it and references personal experience and cultural knowledge to
    discredit the content. Lastly, User B calls for future videos to be made
    with proper methods. User B is asking for a revision to be made.
</p>
<p>
    User C has been included as a demonstration of how food media might induce
    rhetorical action other than identification. User C states, “so every one
    is griping that this isn’t ‘authentic.’ What do we do to make it authentic
    then?” User C is calling on individuals who have displayed authority over
the recipe to revise the recipe. Unlike User B, User C is not commenting to <em>Tasty</em> but rather commenting to the other users interacting with
    the content. All three users display what Linh Dich refers to as “community
    imaginary.” Dich argues that, “To be able to express a racialized identity
    and experience, writers may need to be part of and imagine multiple spaces
    and audiences. After all, race is not just a public or private event, but
    something that traverses theoretical boundaries” (Dich 94). The writers
    here are not just the video producers but also the commenters themselves
    who are calling out to multiple imagined audiences.
</p>
<p>
    User A and B demonstrate the imagining of non-Moroccan audiences when they
    explain the requirements of authentic Moroccan cuisines. Phrases such as “I
    can assure you” (User A) and “let me tell you that” (User B) attempt to
    persuade and defend Moroccan cuisine to potential non-Moroccan audiences.
    Both users reference a “you” and “I,” without clarity as to who they are
    referring to. As spectators we could assume that the “you” is referencing
    the content creators (<em>Tasty</em>), but the “you” also seems to
    be referencing any readers who might stumble upon their comments. The users
    could be writing for both the public “you” and the potential private “you.”
    I say, “could be” because we essentially do not know in what context these
    posts were written. As Jackson and Wallin point out, “It is difficult to
    determine what kind of ‘public’ emerges from the casual exchanges of total
    strangers” (391). The contexts and motives of user composing is unknown to
    audiences, but interactions still display the spontaneous community
    formation that can occur between social media users.

    multiple ways that users consume a digital recipe. Users not only are able
    to share content and share meals, but to share knowledge. User C’s comments
    point to a motivation to not only cook Tagine, but to understand how to
    make it authentically. User C demonstrates a complication to the claim that
    digital food content is only meant to be watched. Instead, User C’s
    potential consumption is shaped by the interactions among other users.
    Regardless of what the video is “meant” to do, the ecological function of
    the digital community creates potentials for users to react in a myriad of
    ways. Spontaneous food communities are unique to digital platforms, as
    Couldry explains that,
</p>
<p>
    People who have never done so before are telling personal stories through
    digital forms, storing and exchanging those stories in sites and networks
    that would not exist without the world wide web and which, because of the
    remediation capacity of digital media, have multiple possibilities for
    transmission, retransmission and transformation available to them.” (374)
</p>
<p>
    Spaces such as Facebook create opportunities for digital storytelling that
    traditional food literature did not. Dich argues that these opportunities
    are especially important for “groups that have been historically excluded
    from public spheres and denied the tools and resources for constructing
    themselves as public figures” (100). Cooking spaces located on social
    media, such as Facebook, have the potential to open food discourses to
    audiences who previously have been excluded. Digital recipes posted on
    Facebook act as a “digital public discourse space,” by providing
    opportunities for minority voices to be inserted into mainstream media
    (Duthely 203).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Breaking the Echo Chamber and Other Potentials</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Users A, B, C, and others not shown (this specific video garnered over
    two-thousand comments) all form a spontaneous digital food community around
    a single digital recipe. Ken Gillam and Shannon R. Wooden explain that,
    “communities function ecologically: interconnected and collaborative, they
    are shaped by myriad factors besides the public utterances of the
    participants. Each participant is also an ever-evolving product of numerous
    contributing forces, conscious and chosen or invisible and involuntary”
    (28). By understanding how comment threads function ecologically, we can
    recognize the forces which shape communities around digital recipes. On
    social media, a major contributing force are the algorithms which filter
    Facebook comment displays. Simply commenting on a video does not result in
    a community formation—this would lead to the same results as the polarized
    communities (lots of people talking, but not to each other). Additionally,
    though, it increases the likelihood that a comment will become buried or
    hidden by Facebook. Interaction among comments (likes and replies) increase
    the likelihood that comments will be displayed at the top of videos. This
    system rewards those who not only engage with the video but engage with
    each other.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to opening up space for audiences who had previously been
    barred from conversations about cooking, digital recipes offer us with one
potential response to social media echo chambers. The creation of a <em>spontaneous</em> community also points us to interactions among
    strangers in different social groups, different places, and often with
    different ethnicities. Even when users share cultural identities they do
    not always agree. Take for example the user comments in the <em>Tasty</em>
    video “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty/videos/1764720153780626/">One-Pot Chicken Fajita Pasta</a>” shown in Figure 3 below.</p>
    <p><img src="img/03-gill.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
    <p id="figure">Figure 3. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty/videos/1764720153780626/">One-Pot Chicken Fajita Pasta</a>, user names have been marked out for privacy.</p>

<p>
    Within the comment section of this video we see again two users who claim
    cultural authority over the food (pasta) by identifying it as part of
    Italian culture. The difference between Users D and E and Users A and B,
    however, is that these two users disagree on what determines authenticity.
</p>
<p>
    Interestingly, User D does not claim to be Italian, but instead recognizes
    that food is tied to physical places. User D states, “If you live in italy
    you grow up learning every little thing about "pasta" and how to prepare
    it. Italian get so pissed because cooking pasta this way is against the
    nature of this food it self.” User D points to authenticity determined
    through experience and geography, implying that knowledge about pasta is
    not just in eating it, but also in other cultural experiences which are
    lived. To know about pasta and learn to prepare it properly, one must not
    just be Italian, but have grown up in Italy. While User D points towards
    one aspect of authenticity, the user does not claim to be Italian. Though
    we can assume from the comment that the user has either lived in Italy or
    knows people who do, they do not explain this in their comment. Rather, the
    user argues that cooking pasta according to the video’s instructions makes
    Italians “pissed” and that other users should not lash out at Italians
    because they are being hurt by the instruction. User D’s statement appear
    to be in response to other user comments which are criticizing Italians for
    being mad about the video.
</p>
<p>
    Similar to the users in the first digital recipe, User D leaves open
    potentials for who the “you” is. The “you” could be referencing themselves
    or the users. Also notable is that User D does not reference an “I” but
    instead references Italians in the third person. So, while User D does not
    claim authority by using personal identification as an Italian, they do
    recognize that Italians are the ones who determine the authenticity of the
    dish. User D’s comments demonstrate Gillam and Wooden’s claim that
    communities function ecologically. User D’s comments are shaped by many
    overlapping relationships between Italians, geographic places, and other
    users in the comment section.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast, User E does claim to be Italian and uses this to offer a
    contrasting view to User D. User E begins their comment in the exact same
    way as User B did in the previous video by stating, “I’m Italian.” The
    difference, however, is that User E uses their identity to qualify a
    statement in defense of the recipe. In addition to calling the recipe
    “delicious,” User E points out other Italian dishes in comparison to the
    dish, stating, “Pasta starch makes it creamy, just like a "risotto".
    Cooking has traditions, that's true, but is also evolution.” Whereas User D
    points to place as an indicator of authenticity, User E utilizes an
    association with another Italian dish, “risotto,” to defend the digital
    recipe. User E’s statement reflects a belief that group identity (and
    culture) can change over time, and just because a dish may not be
    “traditional,” it does not discredit it from being “authentic.” Most
    interesting in User E’s statement, however, is the final sentence which
    states, “And no cooking time in the video, so up to you if you want it in
    pure Italian tradition ‘al dente.’” Here User E demonstrates the rhetorical
    power of a digital recipe like <em>Tasty</em> which lacks detailed
    instructions. Rather than stating times, User E points out that the recipe
    leaves the cook time up to the viewer to decide if they want the dish to be
    “pure Italian tradition.” Once again, User E demonstrates authority by
    referencing Italian cooking (“al dente”) but also extends agency to users
    to choose how they want to cook the dish. Both User D and E participate in
    a dialogue about Italian culture while also recognizing the rhetorical
    potential for users to take action and cook the dish themselves.
</p>
<p>
    Similar to the former recipe, here I have chosen to contrast these two
    users with another user who does not use their identity to make claims.
    User F within this comment section represents a frequent type of commenter
    on digital recipes—the frustrated reader. Rather than being frustrated with
    the video, User F points to the other users who are “whining and
    complaining” over the “combination of 2 cultures into 1 dish.” User F’s
    comment not only calls out directly to the other users in the comment
    section but also recognizes the cultural significance of the dish. User F
    recognizes that foods belong to different cultures while simultaneously
    dismissing user concerns about authenticity by ending their comment with
    “get over yourself.” What this comment demonstrates is that even if the
    food is framed culturally and users claim authority over a dish through
    identity, there will still be users who dismiss the concerns. I include
    this user to demonstrate that appeals to authority or cultural ownership
    are not always effective. Though the content of many digital recipes
    appears neutral, the comment sections demonstrate a tense negotiation
    between users—some optimistic and others pessimistic, but all demonstrating
    a spontaneous community. Within the comment section of many videos like
    this one, strangers on the internet are negotiating issues of identity,
    authenticity, and ownership together. While these conversations are not
    always civil, the interactions between Users A, B, and C and D, E, and F
    point towards a potential for learning from individuals they might never
    have crossed paths with otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Conclusion: Can Social Media Serve as a Structure of Secondary Association?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To return to Hauser’s concern that online spaces are an inadequate
    structure of secondary association because of the proliferation of echo
    chambers, I’d like to point towards the rhetorical impact of digital
    recipes as an artifact which results in spontaneous community formation.
    While Hauser points towards spaces like churches as an ideal structure for
    face-to-face interaction with strangers, <em>spontaneous</em> communities
    develop quite differently. Rather than being organized around a shared
    value (like religion or a unified cause), digital recipes bring into
    contact a much broader audience of strangers for a much briefer moment of
contact. While this article certainly points towards appeals of <em>Tasty</em>, in no way does the data reflect <em>why</em> individuals
    choose to comment. What we do know, however, is that the videos do result
    in one very clear action—a comment. While Hauser contends that online
    spaces will never satisfy the face-to-face contact that structures of
    secondary associations achieve, I argue that what social media does create
    is an opportunity for people from various communities to interact with
    others across the world. Unlike churches, or in Robert Putnam’s example,
    bowling leagues—comment sections are not geographically bound. This point
    is important to note, because while churches and bowling leagues can
    certainly operate as spaces of difference (and I am in no way in
    disagreement with this potential), they are also at risk of becoming echo
    chambers as well.
</p>
<p>
    As geographically bound, these social clubs and organizations are shaped by
    their own selection factors such as city, population, upbringing, age,
    gender, and class. These factors point to one limitation of local
    structures. I do not argue that social media sites or digital recipes
    aren’t susceptible to that risk as well. However, I believe that the
    comments discussed here demonstrate a spontaneous space which looks vastly
    different than the conversation that “once strangers, now friends” would
    have over a bowling game. The widespread circulation of these videos create
    potential for individuals to engage with people from different cultures in
    a way that can result in change of action or perception. Food in particular
    is often a way in which individuals are exposed to other cultures and while
    not everyone can afford to travel or dine out—digital recipes offer an
    exposure which is more financially accessible. For many individuals, these
    spaces may be the only time they interact with a person of color or someone
    from Europe, or even someone who knows what Chicken Tagine is.
    Additionally, the distance which is afforded by social media (with users
    sometimes across the world) provides a space in which marginalized users
    can join conversations with less social risk than face-to-face contact can
    afford. This does not mean the space is without risk for negative
    responses, but rather that they have more potential than being “just echo
chambers”. They are more than <em>just</em> videos. It is more than <em>just</em> food.
</p>

<div id="notes">
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
    <p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">1</a> I want to recognize here that Hauser’s article is referring to
    civic engagement, and the major study he references (Robert
    Putnam’s “Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital”) is
    also referring to civic engagement. I do not mean here to take
    these statements out of context by arguing that we redirect our
    attention <em>away from</em> political content. Rather I think that
    by only looking at political content, we miss out on instances in
    which individuals are interacting with strangers in ways that do
    inform their identity, and I’ll address this more later in the
    article.</p>
    <p><a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2">2</a> For example: choosing local ingredients might demonstrate valuing
    local economies over big corporations or a value of sustainability.
    Cooking a traditional dish may signal valuing family heritage or
    historical accuracy. Eating a healthy dish like a salad may reflect
    values of nutrition, etc.</p>
    <p><a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3">3</a> It should be noted that recently <em>Tasty</em> began releasing
    food videos which do contain dialogue and stories from cooks,
    however only earlier videos are discussed here. Future research
    would need to be done to know whether these new videos result in
    similar community formations.</p>
    <p><a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4">4</a> Within this article I will refer to user comments by letters in
    order to provide privacy. While these videos (and comments) are all
    public, I preferred to respect the boundaries of the community by
    keeping names out of the text. I also do not make gender
    assumptions about the users and instead refer to them as “they” in
    order to keep user gender identity neutral. Lastly, all comments
    are quoted in the same spelling and language as the online comments
    and I have left out [sic] in order to reduce repetition and allow
    for clarity. While screenshots show the comments for comparison, I
    have also linked the videos in each caption so that readers can
    look through other comments or compare those quoted here. Because
    Facebook frequently updates its algorithms to sort comments, these
    comments may no longer be shown as “top comments” anymore. However,
    the comment ranking at the time would have reflected those which
    the community interacted with the most (via likes, reactions, and
    comments).</p>
    <p><a href="#_ednref5" name="_edn5">5</a> It’s important to note that it is impossible to know if the users
    in this particular moment are actually Moroccan. With any online
    interactions (in both research and through our daily lives) we must
    judge for ourselves whether individuals are accurately representing
    themselves. Here, I have taken these users at face value, as others
    in the thread have.</p>
