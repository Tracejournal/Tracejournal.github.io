<h2><strong>Lively, Dangerous Webs: Activism, Actancy, and Delivery in Digital Human Rights Rhetoric</strong></h2>
<h3>Laura A. Sparks</h3>
<h4>California State University, Chico</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: right;">(<em>Published March 11, 2020</em>)</h4>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>
    From human trafficking to genocide to police brutality, in our contemporary
    global landscape it seems atrocities of one kind or another are a constant.
    In the face of such a reality, by what means are we called upon to offer
    our support or agitate for change? Given shifts in digital technologies,
    including the instantaneity of social and news media, opportunities abound
    for engaging with both close and distant human rights issues. While
    researchers in human rights rhetoric and media have published extensively
on witnessing, spectatorship, the circulation of images, and so on,<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"><sup>1</sup></a> they have paid less
    attention to digital delivery and its implications for activism. The
    delivery of these activist opportunities, I argue, depends on actants that
cross digital and material domains.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
    This essay seeks to understand human rights rhetoric as a dispersal of
    agency across a variety of digital and analog networks, media, and objects
    rather than as a restriction of agency to the classic humanist subject.
    From Jane Bennett’s treatment of “actancy” to Laurie Gries’ work on the
    circulation of digital objects, research in digital rhetoric and new
    materialisms increasingly complicates human-centered notions of delivery. I
    propose a new materialist approach to reading digital human rights rhetoric
    via an analysis of the digital outreach of Amnesty International (AI), an
    organization known for its work agitating for global causes. My analysis
    follows chronologically several noteworthy shifts, occurring between 2013
    and 2018, in the AI web site’s development and promotion of a diverse human
    rights agenda. I take up Bennett’s theory of distributive agency, along
    with the work of digital rhetoric and media scholars, to consider the
    vibrancy of the digital activist networks produced and sustained in a web
    site like AI’s. In making the case for a more agentive and “vibrant”
    materiality, Bennett’s and others’ approaches lead to a number of questions
    about how materiality and activism intertwine, including: How are human
    rights issues “delivered” across digital networks? What forms of action do
    activism sites facilitate? What roles might human and non-human actants
    play in the network flows of information and activism? I find that digital
    delivery crucially relies on the participation of non-human actants, and
    that non-human forces meaningfully circumscribe and direct the
    possibilities for humans’ online activism.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to acknowledge up front that contemplating the non-human or
    other-than-human in the context of human rights risks ignoring the humans
    whose lives are at stake. My emphasis on vibrant materials, in Bennett’s
    terms, does not mean to de-emphasize the lived experiences of people whose
    rights are violated in often-horrific ways, nor does it mean to direct
    attention away from the embodied practices so essential to our
    understanding of human rights rhetorics today. Indeed, important work like
    Karma R. Chávez’s “The Body: An Abstract and Actual Rhetorical Concept” and
    Wendy S. Hesford’s <em>Spectacular Rhetorics</em> highlight the ways in
    which bodies—particularly those in marginalized groups—figure significantly
in human rights activism, <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and underscore the ongoing risk of violence against human bodies. In
    concert with those approaches, my intention here is to consider the
    arguably undertheorized role of the non-human across established and
    growing human rights networks, in hopes that such attention will help us
    better theorize delivery and address the rhetorics of human rights in times
    of enduring crisis. That is to say, a full and ethical consideration of
    human rights activism should also attend to the ways in which we work
within distributed networks of non-human actants.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Elizabeth Losh highlights
    a similar concern in “Hashtag #Euromaidan: What Counts as Political Speech
    on Instagram?”, asserting, “the relationship between the body that can be
    counted and the body that can be harmed is central to the cultural
    imaginaries of revolution in the age of computational media and digital
    networks . . . ”At stake in human rights activists’ relation to other human
    bodies are intervening and participatory technologies, from an
    organization’s smartphone application to a web site’s embedded Twitter
    feed. Bodies are enmeshed in digital activist networks, and we would be
    well-served to attend to the forces that co-create those lively, dangerous
    webs.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, I note at the outset that my aim is not to make specific
    recommendations for human rights advocacy, especially as we might imagine
    success to take any number of different forms. Some term social-media
    activism “slacktivism”; the United Nations, for example, as recounted in
    the <em>UNAIDS Outlook Report</em>, defines “slacktivists” as people who
    “support a cause by performing simple measures” but “are not truly engaged
or devoted to making a change” (143).<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"><sup>5</sup></a> And yet, in our digital
    networked world, the internet remains central to how we deliver human
    rights news and causes, coordinate actions, and so on. I am less interested
    in measuring individuals’ devotion to a cause than in understanding how
    users’ participation relies on non-human actants. Indeed, such a focus on
    individual intention or devotion misses entirely the networked assemblage
    within which humans act; as I discuss in later examples, even our capacity
    for measuring human engagement relies on those same digital technologies.
    With rapid shifts in both technology and human rights needs, it is beyond
    the scope of this project to make the case for a singular approach to
    digital activism. Instead, I argue we should better understand the
    rhetorical forms these digital invitations-to-activism might take.
</p>
<p>
    In the following sections, I first trace three related, and often
    intertwined, areas of scholarship that frame my attention to the non-human:
    theories of delivery, digital rhetoric, and new materialisms. I then turn
    to a series of web examples from AI’s site. If we recognize rhetorical
    action as deeply intertwined with the material world, I find we must also
    recognize the persuasive nature of non-human things and begin charting the
    threads of their entanglements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>“Active Texts” in Digital Delivery and New Materialisms</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This brief overview of digital delivery and its relationship to new
    materialisms posits an enriched understanding of delivery that accounts for
    our embeddedness among other-than-human things. I take up Colin Gifford
    Brooke’s call to work “in the middle space” (15) by exploring the role of
    the material and other actants in delivering human rights activism.
    Delivery matters because it is the canon through which we understand
    audiences to take up the rhetor’s enunciation; and in digital spaces,
    including in contexts related to human rights activism, this “taking up”
    not only happens in the midst of, but is also in many ways beholden to,
assemblages of non-human actants.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
    Rhetorical delivery has long been a site where interlocutors must contend
    with new and changing media, but changing digital technologies also afford
    opportunities for rethinking what we mean by “delivery.” Delivery, Ben
    McCorkle notes, is where “given technologies of writing and communication
    (chirography, print, television, hypertext) enter the cultural sphere” (3).
    McCorkle links our attention to elements beyond the human speaker to
    epistemological shifts in the field that have re-centered notions of
    subjectivity, theorizing that “[i]n the absence of a performing human body,
    the media forms stand as avatars in its stead, applying shape, color, and
    texture to the content of a given text” (8). McCorkle observes that
    scholars over the last quarter century recognize delivery in the largely
    nonverbal “surrogate bodies of texts” (140). While he implicitly laments
    shifts beyond the human in his reference to “surrogate texts,” such
    recognition invites us to think beyond “surrogacy” as a term for
    understanding non-human actors. Recent scholarship on rhetorical delivery
    includes attention to the vehicle by which language is delivered (even if,
as I emphasize here, that vehicle is non-human).<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7"><sup>7</sup></a> For example, Collin
    Gifford Brooke refigures delivery in terms of <em>performance</em>, a move
    which is helpful for moving beyond the “transitive, instrumental process of
    transmission” (177) characterizing earlier understandings of delivery, but
    which might move still further beyond the humanist subject.
</p>
<p>
    Building on such advances in delivery, I advocate for more attunement to
less discernable forces, like algorithms or codes,<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8"><sup>8</sup></a> that impact delivery’s
    shapes and forms. If we recognize rhetorical delivery as distributed across
    networks beyond the speaker/subject, we are called to also consider how our
    world-stuffs make delivery possible within a variety of affordances and
    constraints. Such work is consistent with recent research in circulation
    studies that attends to how “bodies, artifacts, words, pictures, and other
    things flow within and across cultures to affect meaningful change” (Gries
    and Brooke). Gries’ scholarship on iconographic tracking, an innovative
    digital research method useful for tracking images’ circulation,
    underscores that scholars must “better account for how digital
    technologies, participatory media platforms, and various actor-networks
    contribute to the circulation and transformation of things in both digital
    and physical realms” (“Iconographic Tracking” 335). I am interested
    particularly in what attention to theories of actancy and rhetoric help us
    understand about how “things become agentive and vital as they engage in
    various activities” (Gries and Brooke). My work, however, resists clear
    distinctions between delivery and circulation, in that I find a robust
    approach to digital delivery attends meaningfully to the non-human.
</p>
<p>
    A new materialist analysis suggests the extent to which digital relations
    are enmeshed with non-human actants. Such a framework shifts the emphasis
    towards distributive agency, “running alongside and inside humans” (Bennett
    viii), so to speak. Arguing that rhetoric is implicated in more than just
    the actions and desires of speakers, Thomas Rickert proposes an “ambient
    rhetoric” (xvi) that understands rhetoric as of the world and attendant to
    ways of being in the world. Rickert’s conception of rhetoric as calling for
    some action and doing so in a way that reveals the world differently (29),
    is essential to recognizing the activity at work in digital delivery. If we
    conceptualize rhetoric as not simply worldly but as “an emergent result of
    environmentally situated and interactive engagements […] that persuades us
    prior to symbolicity” (34), we must acknowledge rhetoric’s material and
    embodied dimensions, as well as its reliance on human and non-human
    interaction. This very notion of “prior-ness” requires us to consider the
    contributions of other-than-human forces. And those relations are less
    about persuasion than, as Rickert says, world-making. What is being
    delivered is not persuasion, per se, but a world.
</p>
<p>
    What might it mean to consider the vibrancy or force of a cursor’s movement
    or the click of a mouse? The anticipatory vitality of an embedded link? In
    digital realms, the text is not merely a passive screen for user
    activities; as James Porter says of discourse, in his work on delivery,
    there exists the potential “for a life of its own” (11). We should also
    then recognize possibilities for a multi-directional and interactional form
    of delivery. Considering rhetorical delivery in terms of interactivity, in
    particular, allows for a reconceptualization of the relationship between
    human and object, and, in the case studies below, between site visitor and
    web text/s. Media researchers Laura Gurak and Smiljana Antonijevic describe
    interactivity as a central component of the web, for Internet users are
    “expected to interact with information” (500). But for this to be “an
    active two-way exchange,” it follows that the information must interact
    back. As research in new media observes, web forms function with a kind of
    movement; what some have dubbed “interactivity,” others call “oscillation”
    (Bolter 105). Rather than emphasizing web texts’ fluidity, for example, Jay
    David Bolter frames these shifts in control between reader and author as
    revealing “joints” and “ruptures” (106). In that sense, interactivity, or
    oscillation, requires not only active authors/creators and readers/viewers
    but also <em>active texts</em>. Estee Beck finds, “algorithms and computer
    code are rhetorical in that algorithms facilitate and function in complex
    acts of information exchange and retrieval across human life domains of
    thought and action.” It is the <em>text</em> or <em>system itself</em> that
    stimulates and engages with users. Attending to interactivity and
    engagement in terms of new materialisms allows a reorientation of agency in
    digital advocacy contexts away from individual actors and toward vital
    enmeshment.
</p>
<p>
    Like nodes in a circuit, these points of intersection generate forms of
    interactivity not only between individuals but between systems. Jane
    Bennett’s and Kevin Kelly’s work underscore the ways in which digital
    engagement relies on a shifting, provisional assemblage of non-human things
that operate in sometimes-unrecognizable forms. Kelly, in <em>What Technology Wants</em>, hones in on the generative potential, the <em>want</em>, operating within systems. He calls our technological system
    the <em>technium</em>, recognizing the ways in which technology seems to
    function as a “self-reinforcing system of creation” (12). Kelly recognizes
    a force that, while anthropomorphized in his own descriptions, nevertheless
    opens up to exceed human potential. In this generative series of “feedback
    loops and complex interactions,” the <em>technium</em>, “spawn[s] a bit of
independence. It [begins] to exercise some autonomy” (12). <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Like nodes in circuit,
    these points of intersection generate forms of interactivity not simply
    between users but between systems. Put another way, technology’s
    imperative, its “growth dynamic” (173), operates largely independently of
    human desires, however much we aim to harness it towards our own ends.
</p>
<p>
    Bennett’s research, too, complicates the idea of clearly isolatable
“objects” serving human capacities. While she acknowledges in <em>Vibrant Matter</em> the vitality of less tangible things, especially
    interesting is what her notion of vital materialities brings to the
    conversation about web-based delivery. Examples early in her book include a
    dead rat and a bottle cap (4-5), but what about that which is intangible?
    She writes that the term “thing-power… tends to overstate the thinginess or
    fixed stability of materiality,” and her goal, instead, is to “theorize a
    materiality that is as much force as entity, as much energy as matter, as
    much intensity as extension” (20). Later, in her discussion of an
    “activeness that is not quite bodily and not quite spatial,” Bennett
    remarks that “[t]his vibratory vitality precedes, or subsists within, or is
    simply otherwise than, formed bodies” (55). This recognition of a
    “vibratory vitality” is especially useful for scholars thinking about
    objects/things that are not necessarily boundaried or visible to the naked
    eye and resonates compellingly with Kelly’s interest in the “kind of force
    [that flows] through technology” (8). While Bennett’s choice of terms
    emphasizes a liveliness, over Kelly’s more human-centric “information,”
    both researchers share a sense of the limitations of materially bound forms
    for understanding the non-human.
</p>
<p>
    Research in delivery, media, and new materialisms invites us to consider
    non-human participation in digital networks, including those in which
    diverse human rights agendas are delivered to users across the globe. The
    new materialist perspective I espouse here highlights the
    interconnectedness of activists, digital media, and vulnerable populations,
    refusing to identify agency with any one actor or group. To more fully
    think through implications for human rights activism, I turn next to a
    series of examples from Amnesty International’s web site spanning five
    years, 2013-2018.
</p>
<p><strong>Web Activism and Amnesty International: Examples from 2013-2018</strong></p>
<p>
    Amnesty International (AI), a London-based non-governmental organization
    (NGO), is heavily invested in using web texts to promote shared interests
    and create and sustain opportunities for action. Founded in 1961, AI is
    explicitly concerned with human rights violations, though its focus is less
on humanitarian aid than on activism and issues of legal justice.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10"><sup>10</sup></a>
    Openly critical of many local and international governing bodies, it serves
    as a useful site for study because of its clear activist agenda, its
    emphasis on the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and
    its long-term investment in online petitions and similar forms of activism.
    More politically radical than other longstanding organizations like the
    International Committee for the Red Cross, and with a historical emphasis
    on mass letter-writing campaigns, AI uses its web presence to promote
    provocative models of activism and visitor engagement. Because AI’s scope
    is international, a particular site visitor might encounter a
    geographically distant cause; thus “the diffusion of media” and “the
    construction of virtual realities and digital activism” render activism
    deeply visible and accessible to millions (Hesford 18). The web site
    “delivers” information about atrocities and other human rights crises to an
    international audience, including an estimated 7 million AI members and
    supporters (“Amnesty”).
</p>
<p>
    The site facilitates user participation largely on a visual level. Human
    rights work, as others have argued, relies heavily on visibility and access
    to information. In her research on human rights spectacles, Hesford
    positions “discourses of vision and modes of visuality” (20) as central to
    human rights law and advocacy. In asking visitors to engage by tweeting,
    following links and reading, downloading articles and posters, donating
    money, and so on, AI delivers an interactive visual space for facilitating
    users’ involvement with pressing human rights issues.
</p>
<p>
    But AI’s web operations function amidst a variety of constraints and flows.
    As part of digital landscapes, they are subject to power fluctuations, the
    limitations of server space, coding changes, shifting social media
    patterns, technological upgrades, as well as creative and practical design
    choices, market and governmental forces, and audience demands. In what
    follows, I consider four moments in the AI web site’s development, all of
    which speak in some ways to the mutability of hypertexts and their
    embeddedness, participation even, in the activities of site visitors.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>2013: The “Activism Center”</em>
</p>
<p>
    The “Activism Center,” rendered in a 2013+ version of the site, drove
    users’ engagement with particular causes by inviting petition signatures
    via taps or mouse clicks. From the link “Take Action” on the right side of
    the home page, underneath “Donate” and “Join,” AI’s site directed visitors
    to the Activism Center, a digital space “where you can take action to help
    end human rights violations around the globe” and “discover how you can
    make a difference.” In this digital space, however, “taking action” was not
    about volunteer opportunities in the field. Rather, advocacy supported by
    the site’s ubiquitous “Take Action” links included signing online petitions
    and writing messages. Other suggested activities included receiving
    “updates on Amnesty International campaigns.” The page listed those causes
    in need of immediate action, suggesting a kind ubiquity of opportunity. One
    line suggested that action-takers “[c]all on the President of Mexico to end
    torture and ensure victims receive justice,” for example. Other recommended
    causes included the Sudanese government’s “attack on NGOs” and Italy’s
    “discriminatory draft law.” The bottom of the page was divided into two
    sections: “Recent appeals doing well,” underscored by a green line, and
    “Actions in need of support,” with a red line. This distinction separated
    out causes by their levels of success (see fig. 1) and used algorithms to
    both track petition signatures and explicitly direct visitors’ engagement.
</p>

<p>
    And yet, while web designer intentions are surely at play, we should also
    understand these digital logics by way of the network of forces engendering
    user response. To imagine technologies and objects as participants in acts
    of delivery is to ascribe to them a capacity for co-production; it also
    suggests the possibility for action. Bennett describes an “intention” as “a
    pebble thrown into a pond, or an electric current sent through a wire or
    neural network” (32)—movement through or towards. The site’s algorithm, in
    this case, determined in real time which appeals were “doing well” and
    which were “in need of support,”—not an individual human intelligence
    curating lists. In her research on algorithms and persuasion, Beck
    explains:
</p>
<p>
    When data inputs into the structure of the algorithm, a type of
    transactional invention occurs, where for a moment, the spatial, temporal,
    and lingual dimensions of the data, algorithm, and circuits come, in some
    sense, [a]live—or live, thus performing ritualized and routine acts for the
    processing and exchange of information. (“A Theory”)
</p>
<p>
    For Beck, these “transactional inventions” highlight the reciprocal nature
    of algorithmic behavior and the human-non human relationships within which
    algorithms operate. In the context of the 2013 Activism Center, we see the
    digital “center” as a key player in not only delivering activist
    opportunities, such as they were, but also delivering engagement and
    interaction back into the system.
</p>
<p>
    The distinction lower down the web page (between those causes in need of
    more support and those doing well) also implied that each cause deserved
    the same level of attention, that they were equal in urgency and
    significance, and that any difference in degrees of support ought to be
    resolved. The distribution of possible “actions” made visible what kinds of
    participation were possible. Actions were thus discrete; they had clear
    parameters, and they were not sustained opportunities for engagement, but
    were rather completed through timely intervention. Site users were not
    encouraged to see a particular problem as persisting over time or as
    wrapped up with other problems, but rather as solvable or addressable
    through individual and collective action.

<p>
    Users could determine the efficacy of their activities only through the
    site algorithm’s numerical tally, whereby multiple highly visible counting
    mechanisms tracked visitors’ efforts. Below its brief description, each
    listed cause included a number identifying how many visitor actions had
    been taken in support of that appeal. On the right sidebar, directly across
    from the Center’s introductory paragraph, the page also included a large,
    bright yellow counter, tallying the total number of actions taken (see fig.
    2). Once a single action had been taken, the numbers rose, such that users
    were treated to an immediate and quantifiable result of their behavior. A
    user’s activities increased the total number, but the number’s high
    visibility suggests that these contributions necessarily relied on an
    identification with others, as well as a relationship to the site itself.
    Visitors were not simply communicating to a particular government about a
    pressing issue but also communicating implicitly with like-minded
    activists—and even more interestingly, communicating with the activism hub
    itself.

<p>
    Viewers performed discrete, countable actions, with the “counting” and
    “sharing” aspects serving as immediate rewards. The hub offered a digital
    space through which the prescribed actions could be taken and then provided
    numerical evidence that visitors had contributed something recognizable and
    significant. In what was a potentially fleeting, distanced form of
    participation in AI’s human rights program, visitors could still identify
    as activists who performed a concrete act against injustice. And through
    this digitally quantified process, visitors were encouraged to see their
efforts as part of a global digital network of action-takers.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11"><sup>11</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
    “Taking action” thus functioned as a communicative act between user and
    system by dint of the increasing, but never satisfied, tally. The
    rhetorical labor involved in these “symbolic actions” manifested through
    aggregate virtual activity. The distinction at the bottom of the page
    between “Recent appeals doing well,” in green, and “Actions in need of
    support,” in red, created and sustained an ever-present sense of
    fulfillment and lack—visitors had just accomplished something important,
    but the need continued. The site itself sustained this cycle of urgency,
    for there were always already causes “in the red.” And, like the counting
    mechanism, these color categories were determined algorithmically. The
    activism hub is particularly interesting here in how it implicitly defined
    “action” and related “actions” to forms of interactivity. Because none of
    the suggested actions (signing a petition, sending a pre-written letter,
    etc.) required visitors to leave their digital devices, any potential
    interactions were on the level of interface. This delivery mechanism
    invited a visitor to simply move down the page clicking on “Take action”
    (see fig. 3). The infinite numerical collation drove further actions, while
    seeming to offer immediate proof of these actions’ success. While a
    “slacktivist” lens might note the limitations of this movement on the level
    of the individual user, a more capacious reading highlights these small
    actions’ embeddedness within a rich, distributed network The counting
    mechanism reinforced the aggregate nature of this form of digital
    activism—one email to a nation’s government may not prompt change, but
    perhaps thousands of emails would—making the digital delivery less about
    individual actions or even the populations whose rights were at stake than
    about what the network and humans collectively contributed. Put another
    way, each visitor’s experience of activism was mediated not only by the
    organization but also by the site itself.

    <em>2013: Hashtags &amp; Social Media</em>
</p>
<p>
    The use of embedded social media feeds, typically for Twitter and Facebook,
    offer additional opportunities for recognizing the human-non human
    assemblage that shifts the terms of possibility for human rights activism.
    Social media feeds can be embedded into a particular web page to show
    up-to-the-minute remarks on a wide range of topics and encourage visitors
    to promote the site or organization from their own social media accounts.
    From an academic’s blog to a site like AI’s, there is persuasive power in
    showing oneself to be a participant in ongoing conversations. Because
    embedded feeds bridge multiple sites, visitors’ engagement with one another
    and with the organization is productively dispersed across digital domains,
    while interactivity is simultaneously positioned within the frame of a
    single web site.
</p>
<p><img src="img/03-sparks.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 3. Screenshot from <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/activism-center/">www.amnesty.org/en/activism-center/</a>, 2 April 2013.</p>

<p>
    Amnesty International’s home page featured for some time a hashtag-based
    feed of tweets in which the organization or one of its chosen campaigns was
    mentioned. These mentions appeared in real time, including both date and
    time stamps. In 2013, for example, the hashtag #RomaRights was featured, so
    any tweets with that hashtag would appear on AI’s site. Visitors to a
    particular organization’s web page were thus exposed not only to its
    content but also to an embedded and simultaneous feed of user and/or
    organization-produced content from elsewhere (see fig. 4). The emergence of
    a feed based in metadata (hashtags) suggested the success of this
    particular strand within the media ecology. Rather than being a passive
    conduit, the hashtag here assembled and organized, constructing a visual
    regime reminiscent of the curated lists of appeals in the Activism Center.
    Avatars, rather than separate causes, took up space, re-centering viewers’
    attention on user action. The intertextual nature of such feeds created
    explicit linkages or co-references between users’ social networking sites
    and the organization’s site, such that visitors were prompted to recognize
    human rights conversations as ongoing and partially diffuse.
</p>

<p>
    In 2018, rather than embedded feeds, injunctions to “Tweet for us,” “Follow
    us,” and “Share our story” emerged—each request invoking popular social
    media platforms and enjoining site visitors to become nodes within the
    activist network, but using a different visual display. Those connections
    rely on non-human participants and conduits, not merely in terms of
    platforms but even in renderings of posts and messages. As Bennett
    explains, an actant “never acts alone”; its “efficacy or agency always
    depends on the collaboration, cooperation, or interactive interference of
    many bodies and forces” (21). In asking visitors to actively promote its
    message, AI renders digital distribution a form of activism itself. As the
    user touches the screen or clicks the keyboard, the assemblage of
    technologies and forces inputs information into the network, making the
    human activist inseparable from the technologies required for
    participation. By harnessing social media in activism sites, human rights
    organizations encourage site visitors to imagine, and thus create,
    themselves as part of this ongoing and interactive assemblage.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em>2011-2016: AiCandle</em>
</p>
<p>
    As the Activism Center and embedded social media examples indicate,
    maintaining an active network of supporters requires making site visitors
    part of the everyday process of providing aid. The assemblage thus moves
    beyond the web site itself. Apps and other social media play a crucial role
    in redirecting possibilities for digital activism from the organization’s
    site toward adjacent devices, networks, and communities. For example, from
    2011-2016, AI supported a mobile app called “AiCandle.” Its tagline read
    “Human rights in your hands” and the images on AI’s web site depicted an
    iPhone displaying a more realistic version of the organization’s stylized
    icon: a candle wrapped in barbed wire (see fig. 5 and fig. 6). Unlike the
    embedded social media feed, in which user participation was imported to
    inside the site itself, the mobile app created a digital place for activism
    closer to home, identifiable by its own icon on a handheld device. With
    AiCandle, supporters would be able to share human rights-related news and
    actions with friends, as well as take part in Amnesty’s campaigns.
</p>
<p>
    Under the headline “Be an activist,” the AI site explained to potential
    users that the AiCandle app facilitated meaningful actions on behalf of a
    range of international campaigns. Each of the suggested actions began with
    active verbs, such as “hold corporations accountable,” “protect women’s
    rights,” and “persuade governments to change their laws and practices,”
    emphasizing the active forms of advocacy enabled by the app. The app’s name
    and opening image invoked the candlelight vigils that are regular features
    of memorials and activist events, implicitly rendering the app user into a
    participant, a supporter holding up a candle. In downloading the app, site
    visitors were invited to become participant-consumers in a human rights
    economy that extended the activist network into a specific location in
    everyday digital life.

<p>
    However, the app was not merely a tool for action but, like its users, a
    kind of participant. The digital candle delivered a simulacrum of the
    familiar human rights-related action of holding a candle in protest,
    mourning, and support, but the app’s resonance was also in its distributed
    nature. For digital human rights advocacy, we see that the timeliness, the
    immediacy, promised by widespread access to human rights concerns can be
    compromised by interruptions beyond human control. While potential
    activists were called take human rights into their hands, so to speak,
    these technologies seemed at times to resist such circuits of influence.
    For example, as multiple app reviewers noted, sometimes the app ran slowly,
    or the candle refused to light up or flicker, and at other times, the
    candle was the only part of the app that worked (“AiCandle”). The app’s
    failures here highlight the ways in which such tools are not neutral
    conduits or invisible pathways for human activity; rather the failures call
    attention to the app’s thinginess—its quirks and oddities, its ability to
    exceed human expectation, design, or direction. Following Brooke’s
    observation that “new media provide us with objects that are not stable”
    (14), we might recognize the ephemerality of the digital candle; its bugs,
    interruptions, and failures to light are reminiscent of both familiar
    technological glitches and actual flames. This digital breeze, so to speak,
    reflects the AiCandle’s independence from human action or even desire; the
    candle “burns” (or not) independent from human match-lighting activity.
</p>
<p>
    The AI app’s emergent qualities were part of the flux and flow of other
    forces, from wireless signals, to the size and feel of handheld devices, to
    the iconic app symbol that stood in for the codes we could neither see nor
    touch, to cumbersome iPhone updates, to the app icon’s arrangement among a
    slew of other icons. The app attempted to, in Hesford’s terms, “bring
    distant human rights and humanitarian crises into an interactive personal
    space” (18), fostering an interactivity that also relied heavily on our
    relationships to our mobile devices. The digital candle was thus not merely
    a “performance” of activism but, following the logic of Rickert’s “ambient
    rhetoric,” it constituted the creation of a kind of environment that
    depended on this app feature—a move ultimately fleeting, given its tendency
    to glitch and its eventual retirement. Delivery is not purely an effect of
    human efforts—rather, as Bennett reminds us in the context of the
    non-human, there is a “confederate agency of many striving
    macro-microactants” (23). The app “delivered” news and causes to a user’s
    phone, but that user’s signature on petitions, notes of support, tweets and
    Facebook posts, and so on, all contributed to an interactive digital
    delivery in which the app and its attendant forces played a pivotal role.
    Deep in these social activist networks is a generative mobility at work
    that relies heavily non-human actants.

    <em>2016-2018: Changes in the Web Interface</em>
</p>
<p>
    Numerous web design experts, from developers to aficionados, note how
    changes in web styles have also shifted viewers’ orientation to web texts.
    Rather than featuring a “news”-style interface, as was initially popular,
    the 2016-and-later AI web site greets visitors with large, even
    screen-filling photographs and minimal (though substantially-sized)
    accompanying text. While links are still visible, the sheer height of AI’s
    latest site invites scrolling to access new information. It is as if the
    site is one long feed. The 2016 page featured few vertical divisions in
    favor of large horizontal sections characterized by massive background
    images.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12"><sup>12</sup></a> (“Page” even
    seems like a misnomer, given that the fold has been unfolded.) The
    relationship between text and graphics has changed, as well. Horizontal
    divisions in the 2016 to 2018 version require viewers to scroll beyond the
    initial background image/s to a trio of graphic symbols and text on white
    space, inviting viewers to temporally evaluate their own human rights
    commitments: “Have a minute?” the first asks. “Have an hour?” “Have
    longer?” (see fig. 7).

<p>
    From the perspective of digital delivery, such changes are significant not
    simply because the content modules, or delivery systems, look different and
    affect human behavior. Rather, changes in the interface shift the
    distribution of agency and even responsibility. Note the difference between
    the 2013 screenshot (fig. 8) and this one from 2016 (fig. 9):

<p>
    Images that span web pages, almost entirely filling up users’ screens,
    demand a different kind of looking—viewers’ eyes are given fewer items on
which to settle. Jacques Rancière explains in <em>The Emancipated Spectator</em>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Emancipation starts when we dismiss the opposition between looking and
    acting and understand that the distribution of the visible itself is part
    of the configuration of domination and subjection. It starts when we
    realize that looking is also an action that confirms or modifies that
    distribution, and that ‘interpreting the world’ is already a means of
    transforming it, or reconfiguring it. (277)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
    Rancière’s approach to emancipation denies any neutrality to the act of
    looking.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He further
suggests, however, that “looking” can be active, if not transformative.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In human rights
    rhetoric, images’ digital circulation and subsequent accessibility in the
    public sphere have remained issues of concern, and we are right to continue
    questioning the ethics of distribution. With concerns of voyeurism,
unethical exposure, objectification, and spectacularization in the mix,<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15"><sup>15</sup></a>
    a tension persists between the import of viewing photographs of atrocity
    and the potential for re-victimization of those depicted. Such visual
exposure can also circulate outside the ethical intentions of advocates.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16"><sup>16</sup></a> There is an ethical
    responsibility entailed in seeing, and the technologies
    producing—pixelating, even—visuals participate in that distribution.
</p>
<p>
    Indeed, the actants in this updated interface ask different things of
    viewers. As I noted above, what just a few years ago functioned using
    embedded links to social networks now encourages movement primarily
    outwards through tweeting or sharing; engagement and participation blur
    together. We see both a new relationship to site content and a new kind of
    movement: from tapping or clicking to scrolling. Bennett’s theory of
    distributive agency “does not posit a subject as the root cause of an
    effect” (31), however, so it would be unfair to claim that the change is
    uni-directional. Shifts in web design that favor scrolling reflect
    developers’ responses to the changing nature of humans’ technology use. The
    growing prevalence of touchscreen hand-held devices, as well as the upsurge
    in mobile sites that make better use of smaller screens, render
    traditionally sized web pages less vital and dissuade developers from
    including heavy linking requirements. It is, after all, so much easier to
    swipe than to click.
</p>
<p>
    The move toward taller page design might also be understood as a shift in
    choice-making. In his oft-cited BuzzFeed article, “Why Twitter Just Turned
    Itself Inside Out,” John Herrman implicitly likens clicks to doors, noting
    that “Favorite, Reply, and Retweet buttons are [now] displayed between all
    tweets. You no longer have to open a tweet, or swipe it, to interact with
    it — you just tap on the action you want to take. Twitter’s doors are now
    wide open. You could say there are no more doors at all.” He further
    explains:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    If there’s one lesson to take from every major change in how people browse
    the internet over the last five years — the rise of infinite feeds, the
    gradual retirement of slideshows and pagination, the explosion of very
    tall, vertically interactive page layouts — it’s that users hate to click
    and don’t mind scrolling. Taps are expensive, swiping is cheap. Clicking is
    a choice, like jumping; scrolling is inevitable, like falling.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
    What does it mean that users apparently prefer scrolling to clicking? Or
    that social media campaigns are not embedded in as much as spread outward?
    As I acknowledged at the outset, it is beyond the scope of this essay to
    offer specific design recommendations. One way to understand the impact of
    these changes, however, is to consider how users are compelled to act,
    impact, or speak back to, the interface. Scrolling certainly implies a kind
    of passivity, and regular smartphone and/or tablet users are no doubt
    familiar with the habitual nature of using their fingers—thumbs,
    especially—to scroll down a smooth screen of a handheld device. While
    clicking means a potentially dramatic shift from one page to another,
    scrolling means a shift in space, across what we might figure as a long
    expanse of flat text—a “scroll.” Scrolling down a long web page can be
    almost compulsive, our actions determined, then, by default.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We know from delivery’s historical associations with hand gestures, shifts
    in countenance, and other embodied actions that delivery has long been
    linked with movement of a kind. But delivery entails more than a
    performance or presentation; delivery also involves co-participants, in the
    sense that delivery requires reception, and ultimately a “taking up.” It
    would be fair to argue that an ethical human rights enterprise offers
    multiple possibilities for taking up, rather than a narrow or prescribed
    avenue to intervention or care. At the same time, in our digitally
    networked world, rhetoric is distributed beyond human goals or intentions,
    making activism an increasingly interactive and co-determined process. So
    what might be the implications for human rights work, as activists look to
    both be conscious users of digital media and resist the spectacularization
    Hesford aptly identifies? For starters, we would be wise to consider how
    participants are invited to understand their relationships to others. In a
    graduate course I teach on human rights rhetorics, we discuss in depth the
    “savior complex” and paternalism that are indelibly intertwined with
    primarily white, Western human rights activism. Just as increased
    globalization allows for broader awareness of abuses, these networks of
    understanding must also direct resources and attention towards local
    activist groups and operate at multiple levels to support the goals of
    particular populations. What this means for individual action is not fully
    parsed, but I contend that recognizing the digital materials involved in
    those efforts is a meaningful component of that process.
</p>
<p>
    As digital interfaces proscribe myriad possibilities for engagement, we are
    called to recognize how digital delivery relies also on the fluid
    distribution of forces through and beyond the human. In considering
    delivery beyond the speaker, I continue to urge a re-orientation to digital
    human rights activism in light of our growing understanding of these
    material rhetorics. It is important that the rhetoric of new media
    “prepare[s] us as writers to <em>make our own choices</em>” (Brooke 15,
    emphasis in original). Just as importantly, however, I argue it should
    attend to how the <em>work makes choices</em>. If we, as we
    should, trouble the notion of digital technologies as neutral or inherently
    equitable, we must also attend to the ways particular technologies act
    with, or even in spite of, human striving.

    <p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">1</a> See, for example, Wendy Hesford’s <em>Spectacular Rhetorics</em>, W.J.T. Mitchell’s <em>Cloning Terror</em>, and Sharon Sliwinski’s <em>Human Rights in Camera</em>.</p>
    <p><a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2">2</a> While I situate my work most fully in the new materialist
    tradition, I use the terms “material,” “actant,” “non-human
    object,” and occasionally “other-than-human” to refer to the range
    of nodes—some more concrete or visible than others—that
    characterize the dynamic interplay of digital human rights
    activisms.</p>
    <p><a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3">3</a>  As Wendy Hesford explores in <em>Spectacular Rhetorics</em>,
      “visual media’s rhetorical force” (192) is simultaneously subject
      to cooptation and capable of rupturing the “objectifying gaze”
      (19). Her extensive work on the Abu Ghraib images demonstrates the
      complexities rife in the circulation and consumption of photographs
      depicting atrocities and problematizes rhetoric’s discursive and
      performative role. Growing attention to rhetoric and the material
      world offers additional insight into understanding how particular
      environments and conditions work on and with human subjects.</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4">4</a>  Elaine Scarry, for example, implies as much in her seminal
        monograph <em>The Body in Pain</em>, in which she argues
        persuasively for attention to the role of objects in world-making
        and -unmaking.</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref5" name="_edn5">5</a> See also the UNICEF campaign, “Unicef Criticizes Facebook
      Slacktivism.”</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref6" name="_edn6">6</a> Along related lines, James Porter advocates rethinking the fifth
      canon in terms of techne, “making,” or creation, in concert with
      non-human technologies. He proposes a series of topoi to guide
      digital writing and suggests in “Recovering Delivery for Digital
      Rhetoric” that contemporary digital scholars theorize delivery in
      terms of techne, or the “matter of bringing form to material in
      order to make something” (210). This emphasis on “making” revises
      our understanding of delivery not simply in favor of the human
      actor once again, but also in favor of technologies (in this case,
      web-based) as participants in the process of creation.</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref7" name="_edn7">7</a> Feminist recovery work, such as Lindal Buchanan’s <em>Regendering Delivery</em>, finds that—while certainly key to
                  our understanding of delivery—body, voice, and expression are
                  insufficient for recognizing rhetorical delivery as “a socially
                  situated act” (3), with its own constraints, affordances, and
                  audience expectations that must be negotiated. This attention to
                  delivery beyond expression or gesture remains significant for our
                  understanding of how rhetorical practice is invented and
                  negotiated, as well as the cultural networks within which rhetoric
                  circulates.</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref8" name="_edn8">8</a> See, for example, Estee Beck’s recent work in <em>enculturation</em>, in which she argues for recognizing algorithms as “language
      objects” and “quasi-rhetorical agents with persuasive abilities.”</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref9" name="_edn9">9</a> One notable example is that of the telephone system. Mathematicians
      have found that telephone messages which a century ago once
      dispersed across the network “in a pattern… [associated] with
      randomness” now resemble “self-organized systems,” specifically the
      fractal pattern. Kelly is careful to note that this doesn’t “prove
      autonomy,” but he nevertheless suggests that such independence can
      be “self-evident” before it is proved (Kelly 14).</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref10" name="_edn10">10</a> For a more in-depth analysis of Amnesty International’s history and
      its novel approach to alleviating human rights violations, I highly recommend Jonathan Power’s 2001 book, <em>Like Water on Stone: The Story of Amnesty International</em>.</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref11" name="_edn11">11</a> It is worth noting that these and other site “actions” produce
      metadata that serve the organization’s purposes of tracking users’
      participation and engagement.</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref12" name="_edn12">12</a> While the Amnesty International homepage is approximately three
      screen lengths tall, that of the International Committee for Red
      Cross boasts a not-inconsiderable eight screen lengths.</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref13" name="_edn13">13</a> For more on using visuals to initiate affective responses, see, for
      instance, David Sheridan, et al.’s “Kairos and New Media: Toward a
      Theory and Practice of Visual Activism.”</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref14" name="_edn14">14</a> Roland Barthes’ “punctum” in <em>Camera Lucida</em> implies that,
      rather simply being looked at, images can interact with us,
      creating sometimes-intimate spatial and temporal folds. Memory and
      what Barthes conceives of as an accidental juxtaposition (i.e., not
      by the photographer’s design) can pierce the viewer into a kind of
      recognition of mortality. We are struck by images.</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref15" name="_edn15">15</a> For more on visibility and the role of the spectacle/spectacular in human rights rhetorics, see also Wendy Hesford’s <em>Spectacular Rhetorics</em>. Hesford introduces the <em>crisis of witnessing</em> to question whether “violent
      representations [are] necessary for the construction of social and
      legal recognition” (99).</p>
      <p><a href="#_ednref16" name="_edn16">16</a> In “Torture Culture,” Dora Apel notes similarities between widely
      circulated lynching postcards and the Abu Ghraib images, suggesting
      that through such visual representations, torture becomes a
      commodity that serves a political function. Apel implicitly locates
      the images as part of a visual economy that participates in, if not
      produces, power relations.</p>
