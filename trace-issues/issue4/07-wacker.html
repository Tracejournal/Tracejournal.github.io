<h2><strong>Following Suit: A Pursuit of Material Process in Multimodal Composition</strong></h2>
<h3>Kali Jo Wacker</h3>
<h4>University of Kansas</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: right;">(<em>Published February xx, 2020</em>)</h4>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
    If I was to say that a kaleidoscope is only as striking as the colors found
    within, most audiences would probably nod heads in initial agreement. It
    would seem plausible, since the patterned rainbow is what keeps people
    occupied when they stumble upon the bejeweled tube. However, a kaleidoscope
    is only as striking as the light that shines through it and bounces off its
    internal mirrors. A kaleidoscope depends on illuminated movement.
    Similarly, I propose, does new materialism and its presence within the
    composition classroom and theories of multimodal rhetoric. This article
    offers up a perspective in which we embrace multimodal composition’s roots
    in multiliteracy and entangle ourselves within the many modes and materials
    of communication. In essence, this article seeks to trace the illuminated
    movement, which will be defined in later paragraphs, of new materialism
    within, through, and outside of rhetorical spaces. Finally, an analysis of
    a small gallery exhibit entitled, <em>Following Suit</em> will provide
    visual examples for this concept.
</p>
<p>
    This exploration is driven by, and conducted with, a focus on new
    materialist theory and various pedagogical theories found within
    composition and rhetoric. This article’s use of new materialist theory
    follows most closely with Coole and Frost’s descriptions in the
introduction of Bennett, et. al’s “<em>New materialisms: Ontology, agency, and politics</em>.” In this
    introduction, they claim that a new materialist approach is one that is
    “evincing eminent modes of self-transformation that compel us to think of
    causation in far more complex terms; to recognize that phenomena are caught
    in a multitude of interlocking systems and forces and to consider anew the
    location and nature of capacities for agency” (9). For Coole and Frost,
    agency is part of an ever-transforming process that extends to many
    networks and connections, and as a result, is always moving. Consequently,
    for this article, illuminated movement is defined as the performance of
    materials that sheds light on, or illuminates, the relationships between
    interlocking systems of communication that are not initially obvious to the
    everyday observer. Simply put, instead of focusing on the question of what
    something is doing/causing, illuminated movement pertains to the processes
    surrounding the actants, or rather, the question of how something is
    doing/causing something and a variety of something elses. As a result, this
    article presents itself as a way of looking, particularly through the lens
    of Barnett and Boyle when they state, “Rhetoric, too, might well designate
    the art of being between: of being between things and yet also being their
    means of connection” (5). I propose that our composition classrooms benefit
    from this understanding of rhetoric, of being and seeing between, because
    instead of emphasizing a message or an actant within a particular
    communication form (or even the message of each particular material within
    that form), it necessitates the acknowledgement of multiple and changing
    messages that are produced by surrounding and ongoing processes.
</p>
<p>
    Jody Shipka’s work is helpful in providing a baseline for new materialism’s
    connection to composition and the composing process. In her multimodal
    task-based framework for composing, Shipka asks students to construct
    multiple approaches to a single assignment, in efforts of facilitating new
    dialogue about how students can approach materials within the classroom and
    the worlds outside of it (<em>Toward a Composition</em>, 279). Many of
    these assignments are returned in forms alternative to the traditional
    essay. They use a variety of materials, such as wine bottles, ballet shoes,
    children’s toys, and blueprints—just to name a few (Shipka,
    “Negotiating Rhetorical” W345). This plurality of design hints at the
    multiplicity of underlying messages. However, this acknowledgement is only
    the very tip of a very large iceberg. It is one thing to notice the
    messages; it is another to pinpoint how they came into existence and how
    they continue to be and become.
</p>
<p>
    To help chisel away at this idea, especially with its high-risk for
    becoming too abstract, Douglas Eyman’s definition of digital rhetoric, Jody
    Shipka’s study of material engagement in composition classrooms, and the
    “materializing” of Kairos (814) by Sheridan, et al., are used in this
    article to help identify and understand the many messages embedded within
    composing processes. Additionally, within each example of scholarship
    mentioned above, it is hard to deny the presence of the initial goals and
    practices of multiliteracy and multimodal composing, and it is in this
    context that communication forms—digital, physical, and every combination
    in between—can be helpfully seen as intertwined and with binaries tangled,
    mangled, and interwoven.
</p>
<p>
    Coined by The New London Group in their 1996 article, “A Pedagogy of
    Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures,” and developed further in the
    Bill Cope and Mary Kalantzis’s resulting book in 2000, <em>Multiliteracies: Literacy Learning and the Design of Social Futures</em>, the term “multiliteracy” addresses the increased globalization of
    communication and literacy in terms of people, media, and public exchange.
    More recently, Kathleen Tyner explores this term in her 2014 book, <em>Literacy in a Digital World: Teaching and Learning in the Age of Information</em>, where she states: “Multiliteracies related to communication and
    information, notably media literacy, computer literacy, visual literacy,
    information literacy, network literacy, and technology have stepped forward
    to define the changing, amorphous shape of communication needs for a
    society awash in electrical sounds, images, icons, and texts” (64). This
    “amorphous shape of communication needs” acknowledges five communicatory
    modes—Linguistic, Visual, Audio, Gestural, Spatial, with an added sixth,
    Material, which brings in a new materialist literacy, which will be
    highlighted and explained throughout this article. All have fluid
    relationships to one another, and it is this fluidity that begs for a new
    way of looking, one in which agency is seen as amorphous as the messages it
    provokes. However, instead of specifically focusing on Bennett’s “thing
    power” (<em>Vibrant Matter</em> 3) in which actants and forces impose their
    will on each other, this article looks at this power through a distanced
    Latourian lens of “tracing of associations” (5). This article’s idea of
    illuminated movement, then, works alongside Latour’s networks and Bennett’s
    thing power to understand the processes that surround, work within, and
    move through them. Since these ideas are focused on process, I analyze a
    small art gallery exhibit that I created my senior year of undergrad as a
    journalism and graphic student exploring multimodal composition. This
    allows for a deeper look into the processes underlying its creation. Since
    the exhibit’s construction was based on growing scholarship on multimodal
    and multiliteracy practices within the composition classroom, such as
    designing and making, this article provides both educators and students
    with insight into multimodal composition’s rhetoric of performance,
    preservation, and revision via a new materialist way of looking. In
    concluding, I provide a course activity and assignment that corresponds to
    this exhibit and is designed to illuminate the kaleidoscopic nature of
    multimodal composing.
</p>
<p><strong>Designing &amp; Making</strong></p>
<p>
    The terms “designing” and “multimodal composing” have a deep history
    together. The often-cited 1996 manifesto of The New London Group positioned
    the act of designing as a shaping and re-contextualization of meaning,
    based on what structures (environments, texts, values, people, and
    technology systems) are available (75). The Group’s focus on designing was
    to demonstrate how, as a semiotic activity, designing would “more or less
    normatively reproduce, or more or less radically transform, given
    knowledge, social relations, and identities, depending on the social
    conditions in which Designing occurs” (75). As such, it could be used as an
    umbrella term similar to reading, seeing, listening, and writing, which
    were all designing acts according to The Group (75).
</p>
<p>
    Variously echoed by composition scholars Gunther Kress, Jennifer Rowsell,
    Mary Sheridan, Mike Sharples, and envisaged by design scholar, Richard
    Buchanan, designing was juxtaposed with the <em>performance</em> of
    writing. In 1985, <em>Design Issues</em> published Buchanan’s call for
    rhetoric and design to be seen as synonyms, or at very least, highly
    compatible in structure and intent. Composition took up this call. Kress
    contended that design is the process of meaning-making when the rhetorical
    purposes of the designer (teacher, student, communicative human being)
    become messages, with writing being one instantiation (28). In 2010,
    multiple ethnographic case studies and interviews conducted by Sheridan and
    Rowsell revealed that design answers similar questions in the corporate
    world as those asked in the composition classroom, especially those
    pertaining to how reading, writing, and listening are dynamic, relational,
    and performative acts that are transformed through multimedia and
    multimodality (Sheridan and Rowsell 33). Design and writing were seen as
    having the same or similar bases of inquiry.
</p>
<p>
    However, Sharples had already proposed an answer to these questions in his
    1998 book, <em>How we write: Writing as Creative Design</em>, by
    appropriating the qualities of design that are identified in Brian Lawson’s
    book, <em>How Designers Think</em>. His argument was more academia-focused
    and had just started to attribute designing to multimedia and technology,
    particularly with early case study examples of online authoring, adventure
    gaming, and word processors. However, with technology just beginning to
    change the writing landscape, his aim was made more in effort to use design
    as a way to demystify what he saw as the ambiguous writing process and less
    a call to learn from existing designing practices from outside the academy,
    as was the goal of Sheridan and Rowsell a decade later.
</p>
<p>
    Making then, surfaced in the early 2000s as an act of multimodal composing
    and design that supported a heightened interest in materiality and New
    Materialism studies. Making took on similar meaning-making attributes to
    design but did so with an emphasis on the physicality of communication.
    Performance was no longer just process; here, in the realm of making and
    materiality, it became embodiment. In fact, in David Sheridan’s 2010
    article, “Fabricating Consent: Three-Dimensional Objects as Rhetorical
    Compositions,” he claimed that great rhetorical freedom and power could be
    gained from tapping the “rhetorical potential of three-dimensional
    fabricated objects.” When Sheridan wrote about making, he focused on two
    main principles: 1) people and process are integrated and 2) when digital
    die cutters and sewing machines and 3D printers meet with what composition
    often associates with design, this act of composing morphs into making in
    its most general form . This idea is highlighted in many of Jody Shipka’s
    composition courses in which she has assigned material-driven projects,
    such as the “Mass Observation Project” in which students recorded the
    everyday lives, interactions, and performances of their classmates to study
    actions, reactions, and interpretations of events, communication, and
    things over the span of an ordinary (or extraordinary) weekend (“Mass
    Observation Project”). However, in both these instances of scholarship and
    practice, the multimodal composing process was comprised of two major
    parts—multiliteracies and materialization—and the constant collision of
    these two components are what make up my theoretical framework for this
    article. They are what require a renewed way of looking.
</p>
<p>
    Scholars like Jody Shipka and Matt Ratto, Megan Boler, and Ronald Deibert
    focus on the act of making largely to establish a theoretical backing and
    pedagogical application for the more specific expressions of making:
    crafting, tinkering, hacking, and remixing. Each of these forms of making
    have different values and expectations placed upon them—crafting
    scholarship largely focuses on composing with traditional practices, early
    craftspeople mentalities, anti-capitalism, nostalgia, and preservation.
    Hacking often brings forth ideology from programming, counterculture,
    anarchism, and revision (Hendery, Rachel et al,) Tinkering values a
    process-based emphasis on exploration and the performance of composing, and
    remix rebirths composition’s long-time relationship with revision and
    re-seeing as a very physical, and often digital, collaboration of
    recreated, appropriated, and recontextualized communicative works. As these
    examples attest, the underlying processes of multimodal composition
    continue to revisit the rhetorical elements of performance, preservation,
    revision, which are often principal features of the composition classroom.
</p>
<p>
    As a result, regardless of which variation of design and making is being
    explored—both are largely documented through teacher scholarship (Shipka,
    Ratto) and ethnographic case studies (Tomko, et al.) in attempt to explain
    what happens during the making/designing process as well as to facilitate
    it in a classroom setting. Writing scholarship has used “teaching moments”
    of producers’ daily work lives (Sheridan and Rowsell 61) to discuss the
    need for critical evaluations of and experimentation with design and has
    offered example write/design/make assignments, syllabi, and activities for
    teaching multimodal composing (Arola, Ball, and Sheppard). This article
    does something similar, and a corresponding assignment guideline can be
    found in the appendix.
</p>
<p>
    Together, making and designing help create a model for a combined way of
    thinking, one in which communication forms are often tangled, and where
    digital and physical elements are a part of the same composing process,
    regardless of how tactile or traditional a particular composition or text
    seems. It situates multimodal composition as a process of performative
    hybridity, intermittent preservation, and continuous revision.
</p>
<p>
I now turn to a descriptive analysis of my undergraduate senior showcase, <em>Following Suit</em>, which operates as an art-based pedagogical model
    for how a new materialist perspective can strengthen students’
    understanding of composition, writing, designing, and making in their
    increasingly multimodal, and inescapably digital, academic environments.
    This exploration seeks to answer the question of: “What digital modes are
    folded within, and are a part of, the underpinnings of the material? And
    more specifically: “How does a tactile exhibit teach students about
    multimodal composing in regard to performative hybridity, presentation, and
    revision?”
</p>
<p>
    Through an investigation of material objects—both on the process and
    product level—I plan to identify how similar composition methods can be
    transferred into the writing classroom and can allow for a more
    multifaceted understanding of composition and its materially digital
    existence among my students. For the sake of clarity, I will first describe
    my gallery exhibit in enough detail and imagery to give my readers a
    general idea of the showcase, both in process and product. Then, I will
    focus on three main art pieces, briefly analyze them materially, and
    discuss resulting digital realities to show their tangled nature. Finally,
    a classroom activity that draws upon similar principles will be discussed
    and paired with a follow-up assignment in the appendix.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Following Suit</em>
</p>
<p>
    In the spring of 2013, the idea for my <em>Following Suit</em> exhibit
    began with a single artwork constructed in my introductory sculpture
    course. The task set before us was simple: pick a subject and material that
    are seemingly unrelated and create something that has a collective meaning.
    Consequently, I took playing cards from my family’s game room and tapestry
    thread in memory of my grandmother’s quilting and constructed a full-size
    guitar, and in the cards’ new configuration, a small part of my family’s
    heritage was conveyed.
</p>
<p>
    Although this might seem rather human-centric with materialist rhetoric
    being secondary to my personal manifestations, I wanted to show how
    something as important as family heritage could be embodied through an
    eclectic cacophony of typically unrelated, and sometimes seemingly
    negligible, materials. I wanted to repurpose their original use, imagery,
    and agency and transpose new meaning upon them by extending their embedded
    material potentialities. Additionally, I wanted to demonstrate how, to me,
    art is in the intentionality behind the materials selected, the creative
    choices made, and the consequential dialogue that persists thereafter. It’s
    in the futurity, much like Laurie Gries’ points out in
    <em>Still Life with Rhetoric: A New Materialist Approach for Visual Rhetors</em>
    (12) and in the “vibrant materiality” articulated by Jane Bennett that
    “runs alongside and inside humans” and gives particular focus to the
    agencies and exigencies of related and unrelated materials (viii). In
    essence, I wanted the materials to speak to me, and for my story to speak
    in cadence with those materials. As Carole Blair writes: “Rhetoric's
    materiality constructs communal space, prescribes pathways, and summons
    attention, acting on the whole person of the audience. But it also allows a
    rhetorical text to ‘speak’ by its mere existence, to endure by virtue of
    the durability of its composition, to be preserved by particular modes of
    reproduction, and to act on other texts (48).” This speaking is what I
    wanted my audience to think about as they roamed the art gallery and what I
    want my composition students to grapple with during my courses. I want my
    students to ponder messages being communicated that aren’t necessarily in
    writing. I want them to look for the messages that don’t even reach the
    final product. I want them to think about the dialogue that exists between
    the materials, instead of just between the artist and audience.

<p id="figure">Figure 1. “The Guitar Player,” mixed media sculpture, 2013</p>

<p>
    The guitar shown in Figure 1 became the main subject of an automated
    slideshow overlaid with spoken audio recordings and acoustic guitar
    background music. I used this short example of multimedia to introduce a
    multimodal project for my English 101 sections at the University of Kansas.
    My reasons for this was twofold: First, I wanted to demonstrate how
    messages&mdash;even those not written or spoken&mdash;can be recycled and manipulated
    for new purposes. Second, I wanted to show my students how this movement
    from one medium to another doesn’t completely erase the one that came
    before. A sewn deck of cards was preserved and repurposed even half a
    decade after its original creation. The physical never left the digital and
    this hybridity is key in understanding the original and repurposed message.
    As Shipka writes, “Highlighting the various texts, tools, strategies,
    practices, and participants&mdash;both human and nonhuman&mdash;that play a role in
    supporting, facilitating, altering, and at times, even thwarting or
    forbidding the production of a focal text, product or performance allows us
    to move beyond human-centered or human centric notions of agency, effect,
    and collaboration” (“Transmodality” 253). This cycle between process and
    product allows us to acknowledge the potential for materials to create
    alongside the creator. My artworks’ vitality, its speaking, changed and
    continues to change with every person and every mode that interacts with
    it. In the sections to follow, I will provide a mini-analysis of the
    materials used in three specific pieces (“Nafplio,” “The Family Tree,” and
    “Raising Butterflies”) and then show how their material potentials were
    expanded and how they answer multimodality’s call for hybrid performance,
    preservation, and revision.
</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid Performance</strong></p>
<p>
    Although at first glance, “Nafplio” is merely a grouping of playing cards,
paint, and old bus stubs, it surpasses a singularly tactile existence. In <em>Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice</em>, Douglas Eyman states,
    “The term ‘digital rhetoric’ is perhaps most simply defined as the
    application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for
    production) to digital texts and performances” (Eyman 44). It is within the
    final word—performance—that the heart of this artwork lies. “Nafplio”
    started as a photo taken on a Canon t3i Rebel. Standing on a rock path, I
    captured it along with 4,000 other photos of Greece. It was transferred to
    my MacBook Pro, edited on Photoshop, where I adjusted the size and
    saturation, and then printed in several orientations. Many could place
    these instantiations within the digital performance category of Eyman.
    However, what of the painting? Without the photo or the digital origins of
    my collected paper trail, my final project would never have been created,
    and the materials I gathered would have never achieved the level of agency
    they did. The digital preservation of a particular place allowed for the
    tactile representation of it. One could not be without the other. The piece
    is a hybrid performance, even when it lacks an apparent digital quality. As
    a result, the performance can re-envision composition as an embracing of
    multiple literacies where writing occurs and where communication is
    linguistic and aesthetic and material and inherently digital. The product
    does not necessary provide a peephole into the process that came before nor
    the one that will come after. However, by mindfully tracing the illuminated
    movement of material—from camera to computer to sketch to collage to
    painting&mdash;one can discover a dialogue that surpasses the communicatory
    potential of the final product.
</p>
<p><img src="img/02-wacker.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 2. Figure 2: “Nafplio,” mixed media painting, 2015. Materials: (mixed media)
Phase 10 playing cards, bus tickets, museum pamphlets, flyers, notes,
brochures, receipts, tapestry thread, acrylic paint, oil paint.</p>

<p>
    For example, the process started with my returning suitcase being littered
    with forgotten things&mdash;the worn ticket stubs and crumpled receipts from the
    adventures gone by. This Greek landscape painting is made of Phase 10
    playing cards stitched together and stretched over a traditional wooden
    frame. Collaged on top of the cards are my collected materials, which
    served to break up the grid pattern of the playing cards and provide added
    texture for the painted landscape.
</p>
<p>
    On their own, old receipts and flight itineraries are rarely stared at in
    wonder. However, in this painting, their edges and outlines peak through
    and garner additional attention of its viewers. They become a “Where’s
    Waldo?” type of phenomenon and cause viewers to squint their eyes and stare
    with heightened intensity and curiosity. These simple, typically discarded
    materials become items of special interest simply because of their
    placement, and they serve as a real-world reminder to the life of a
    traveler that happens within the Nafplio peninsula. The stitching preserves
    a sense of labor and planning, and the incorporation of these elements, as
    Bennett would say, “draws attention to an efficacy of objects in excess of
    the human meanings, designs, or purpose they express or serve” (20). The
    materials create meaning alongside my own, and any digital underpinnings
    seem hidden from view.
</p>
<p>
    However, “Nafplio,” preserved in a photo, reproduced in a painting, and
    then preserved once more in photographs, continues to communicate, even
    outside of its previous contexts&mdash;it was once in a gallery, but now hangs in
    a living room and resides within several Facebook albums and phone photo
    galleries. Additionally, each year in the middle of April, this picture
    pops up as a Facebook memory for many of those who attended the exhibit.
    The exhibit continues to move and morph. As a result, if we can see the
    digital and physical as concurrent and inseparable parts of origination,
    production, and preservation of even seemingly “physical” rhetorical
    objects, then we might also be able to further discover the ways in which
    new media perpetuates, pervades, and enhances not only diverse media
    ecologies but also diverse classrooms and pedagogies. Hybrid performance,
    then, is not about what we see, but about the movement before, during, and
    after a composition&mdash;whether it be a painting or otherwise.
</p>
<p><strong>Preservation</strong></p>
<p>
    Preservation is not new to composition. The existence of memory studies and
    the number of memoir courses housed within English departments across the
    U.S. make it hard to state otherwise. Similarly, museums and tribute art
    exhibits speak to a need for preservation&mdash;of thoughts, of emotions, of
    concrete and abstract things. Multimodal composition has the ability to
    combine the concepts of the written memoir with the visuals gained from
    other preservation practices, and often composition scholars situate these
    within the new materialist lens of bricolage and assemblage. Within these
    foci, I think Bennett best captures their motivations when she states, “An
    assemblage…not only has a distinctive history of formation but a finite
    span of life” (<em>Vibrant Matter</em> 24). At first glance, this might
    seem to run contradictory to hybrid performance; however, Bennett goes onto
    illustrate how the assemblages of things change, but their vitalities don’t
    end; they simply set forth a new material potential (24). Performance
    regards movement; preservation regards many of the stops along the way.
    Subsequently, although not in their original capacities, materials allow
    for continued engagement, reproduction, preservation, and action.
</p>
<p>
    Consequently, during my show, I quoted Ralph Waldo Emerson stating that,
    “Every book is a quotation; and every house is a quotation out of all
    forests, and mines, and stone quarries; and every man is a quotation from
    all his ancestors.” I used this to allude to how every art piece is a
    quotation, or a mere fragmented reality, of the materials that preceded it.
    The agency and the effervescence of an object can continue even when
    reassembled or reconstructed. “The Family Tree” banked on this assertion
    during its two exhibitions, and now, continues to do so, although in a
    quite different capacity.
</p>
<p><img src="img/03-wacker.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 3. The Family Tree,” Sculpture, 2015. Materials: traditional playing
cards, tea, coffee, hot cocoa, canning jars, baby food jars, tea lights,
scanned photos, fishing line, cooling racks, &amp; electrical tape.</p>

<p><img src="img/04-wacker.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 4. A close-up of the photo jars.</p>

<p>
    The materials acting within “The Family Tree” span generations and its
    rhetorical engagement takes shape in a more temporal capacity. The jars,
    both for baby food and canning, were collected from various friends and
    family members&mdash;some of the canning jars had been in use longer than I’d
    been alive. Within these jars were white, battery-powered tea lights and
    scans of old heirloom photos spanning back to the tintypes of the
    mid-1800s. As a result, many of the images were of men and women I’d never
    met and who had often never met one another. Time had separated their
    meeting, but their material legacy had connected them thereafter, and their
    digitization had preserved their being (See Figure 3). Prior to this,
    protection was only granted via safe storage inside waterproof boxes, and
    each photo shows varying degrees of aging that are the inevitable
    consequences of the passage of time and rudimentary picture-taking
    practices of early photography. Digital scans of these items bring renewed
    sense of captured time, since the slow disintegration is stopped in this
    secondhand form. Simultaneously, recent generations were connected and
    reconnected. An acute awareness of mortality guided my creative process. My
    mother always told us that we couldn’t bring our stuff with us when we die
    as a way of teaching us that the important things in life aren’t material.
    However, with this project, I wanted to propose that we are looking at the
    material from the wrong perspective, a self-indulgent one that devalues the
    vitality of an object and its ability to cross boundaries and at times,
    defy the temporal realities we have as humans. These images outlasted the
    subjects they depict. Many of the pictures are now just names and dates. No
    memories nor nostalgic connections are made with them other than what is
    born from knowing that blood is somehow shared between the unfamiliar
    faces. However, the sepia coloring (edited on both old and new photos), the
    intentional aging of the materials, and the unchronological ordering of the
    photos help remove any sort of definitive timeline. The materials preserve
    generations while simultaneously equalizing them. Additionally, the canning
    jars, which are typically seen as objects of preservation, are used to
    house the photos and lights, acting almost as a memorial. As a result, the
    tree is seen as both celebratory and somber because of the materials used.
    By knowing how these objects interact&mdash;the canning jars for preservation,
    the tea lights for commemoration&mdash;I was able to use these potentials in
    tempo with my own intentions. Preservation became an assemblage of family
    history and a digital archive. The former could not have been constructed
    without the latter.
</p>
<p><strong>Revision</strong></p>
<p>
    Performance and preservation cannot, however, complete a cycle on their
    own. Revision is often encountered in order to spur on continued travel.
    Sometimes people make revisions; sometimes materials do their own adapting;
    sometimes time makes the changes for both. Regardless, revision is a key
    part of the composing process, particularly because it allows for renewed
    vision and vitality. This six-canvas picture in Figure 5 is a tribute to
    that. One summer, I worked at a hardware store, and hundreds of paint cards
    were discarded each week. Overtime, I began collecting them, if for no
    other reason than to give them purpose beyond the trash. As a result,
    “Raising Butterflies” became a wallcovering out of the very materials used
    to help others determine what they wanted to cover their own walls with.
</p>
<p><img src="img/05-wacker.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p id="figure">Figure 5. “Raising Butterflies,” Mixed Media, 2016. Materials: paint chips,
hot glue, black canvas.</p>

<p>
    The paint chips, laboriously cut into teardrop shapes and shorted by color
    served to recreate a drawing entitled “Butterfly Wings” that I gave my grandfather during my freshman year of high school. The
    original picture was black and white, so regardless of the colors
    collected, I could use my paint chips in any assortment. Additionally,
    whereas the original sketch took merely minutes to create, my paint chip
    collage took an upwards of three months to complete. Subsequently, the new
    materials extended the process, added color to the original design, and in
    a way, allowed for the preferences, as well as scribbled handwriting of
    strangers and past co-workers to dictate the reconstruction. I only used
    the discarded remains of customers’ painting adventures, and thus, my color
    palette depended on their choices, even with them never knowing about my
    art piece. The original image was revised according to size, color,
    material, process, intention, time, and accessibly.
</p>
<p>
    As one can see, the materials used in each of these art pieces perform
    their own rhetoric beyond my artistic intentions, and in many ways embraced
    the aspects of performance, preservation, and revision that we often teach
    about in our composition classrooms. The materials themselves played key
    roles in the artwork I ended up creating. They were the purveyors of the
    process&mdash;as was the digital in more interstitial, but still very present
    ways. Consequently, this opens up the importance of a new materialist view
    of process in a product-driven world and in a multimodal communication
    system. It helps us see how the digital and physical elements are fluid
    materials in our current educational environment, and how our classrooms
    might benefit from activities and assignments that seek to illuminate this
    entanglement.
</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>
    These ideas of multiliteracy and materialization have crossed over into
    practice within my introductory composition courses. Reborn as classroom
    activities, my art exhibit and theories about its process have been a point
    of emphasis for my students. Through striving for multiliteracy, my
    students can come to understand that composing often reaches beyond the
    linguistic into visual, auditory, gestural, spatial, and material
    realities. In practice, these realities become intertwined and woven into
    an often digital-physical hybrid existence, through the constant
    performance, preservation, and revision processes of materialization. I’ve
    included one classroom activity with a follow-up, low-stakes assignment in
    the paragraphs to follow, centering on a the “Nafplio” artwork described
    above.
</p>
<p><em>Featured Classroom Activity: </em>The Great Symbolism Debate</p>
<p>
    Like the “Nafplio” painting, this activity emphasizes the performance of
    seemingly static visuals. The classroom is divided into five groups to
    create four teams and one jury panel. On the board, each team is assigned a
    color and two symbolic illustrations (i.e. a sun, a skull and crossbones, a
    pine tree, etc.). Every group has access to at least one computer. Over the
    course of three rounds, students research their given color or symbol to
    create an argument as to why their particular component holds more “power”
    than those given to other groups. During these research frenzies, they are
    to consider how symbols and colors change when viewed through the different
    lenses of psychology, history, geography, culture, science, religion,
    philosophy, literature, and generation. Then, they are to formulate their
    evidence in a way that effectively utilizes the rhetorical appeals of
    logos, pathos, and ethos. Each team then gives their argument and the jury
    panel deliberates the breadth of research given as well as the way it was
    presented. Then, after three rounds, a final “Sudden Death” round is
    undertaken, in which teams form an overarching argument that includes their
    previously argued subjects. Their previous items and research become an
    assemblage of power that they are then asked to reveal. They battle “to the
    death,” in a head-to-head battle with a team of their choice. Competition
    is employed within this activity to spark interest in a need for in-depth
    analysis. Each round tends to become more intense, and by the end of the
    game, students are often performing various degrees of intellectual
    synthesis as well as analysis, which proves quite useful in their course
    assignments. This activity helps move students toward considering the
    agency of materials, because once a foundation is created in which symbols
    create agency, we can move onto how this transfers to materials themselves.
</p>
<p>
    This transfer, then, is engaged within a follow-up, low-stakes assignment
    (the prompt is available in the appendix). Since each group was assigned a
    color and set of symbols for the debate, they are asked to continue
    pursuing connections and evidence throughout the rest of the semester. Each
    group is given a 2.5 gallon Ziplock bag and is responsible for adding at
    least one item to it each week. Students can choose to bring an image (or
    some form of representation) of the item, a piece of the item, or the
    actual item itself to be kept in the bag. Then, in the final week of the
    semester, the items are revisited as an assemblage, and students then
    compose their original arguments in an alternative, material-based way.
    They are required to use at least four of the outlined communicatory modes,
    and their argument must somehow connect all items in their Ziplock bag.
    This assignment often takes much brainstorming initially; however, when
    coupled with a semester’s worth of multimodal activities and assignments,
    students tend to be receptive and willing to accept the challenge.
</p>
<p>
    All of this is to say that when one looks at the interrelatedness of
    multiliteracy and materialization, some of the rhetorical underpinnings
    (that often go unrecognized when traditional, human-centric viewpoints come
    into play) can be realized. Although we can never detach ourselves from
    human focus, we can temper it with an understanding of something’s material
    prerogatives. Once realized then, my art and my pedagogy demonstrate how
    material rhetoric can facilitate our own communicative purposes—whether
    through art or through various compositional modes: PowerPoints, videos,
    item-based assemblages, and so on. In order to understand the process of
    something, one must first understand its underlying entanglements.
</p>
<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>
<p>
    As before-mentioned scholars might suggest, many writing instructors are
    moving toward a more heterogeneous understanding of what composition
    entails. We’ve seen scholarship move us anywhere from social media to
    service learning. And as a brief glance into those might reveal, learning
    and skill acquisition is going beyond the traditional classroom setting.
    Scholars are actively incorporating the everyday into the academic as a
    merging of intellect and experience (Lynch). Multimodality capitalizes on
    this infusion by using multiples modes to convey a particular message, and
    many of these modes are found in students’ everyday experiences. A flier on
    a bulletin board, a sticker on a laptop, an announcement on the radio, a
    text from a friend, a tweet from a celebrity—all of these forms of
    communication undergo the act of composing, and as a result, all of these
    have innately material realities that are part of digital ecologies that
    are often overlooked. This is where an understanding of an artistic
    communicative process, such as the one described above, can benefit from a
    new materialist perspective, which can help enhance communication in our
    classrooms.
</p>
<p>
    Multimodality allows for plurality of a message, but materialism helps with
    the conception and underlying processes. It illuminates the movement behind
    rhetoric. By understanding the vibrancies within objects and the relational
    happenings among them, through them, and often with digital apron strings,
    we might then be able to harness their exigencies within multimodal
    composition. However, just as a person can’t construct a watch without
    first understanding how the inner gears interact or can’t build a bench
    without understanding durability and weight constraints, effective
    communication acts upon the existing realities of a material, which span
    farther than the initial eye might see.
</p>
<p>
    Our classrooms, then, can become spaces for objects, humans, and networks
    to be discussed, and for performance, preservation, and revision to
    influence our understanding of the communicative modes our students choose
    to use, create, and recompose. Because, just as art is a very material
    endeavor, so is English composition&mdash;whether a traditional paper, a
    multimodal project, or otherwise. It’s an illuminated movement where all
    parts must be acknowledged in unison in order to start to understand how
    the pervasiveness of rhetoric, the affordances of multiliteracies, and the
    process of materialization are in constant motion.
</p>
<p>
    This article suggests a different way of looking, one in which the
    kaleidoscopic wonder of rhetoric is illuminated through a tracing of
    material process. An art gallery exhibit was used to help identify
    material-based messages, particularly in regard to performance,
    preservation, and revision. However, maybe most importantly, it attempted
    to reveal the life that lies beyond initial observation of something. It
    highlighted the transformative behaviors of materials due to human and
nonhuman forces, and in doing so, revealed equally transformed dialogue. <em>Following Suit</em> was a gallery exhibit at first glance, but upon
    further exploration it was a cacophony of stories, riddled with half-told
    whisperings of bus trips, card games, and bloodline strangers. It revealed
    how looking can become listening, even if no words are uttered. I propose
    that our students need to dabble with this kind of looking, the kind where
    eyes can hear and feel as well as see. I propose that they need to become
    entangled in the many messages a material has potential for, and that is
    predominately why I have them partake in a semester-long collecting
    assignment. In addition to their final, multi-material, multimodal
    argument, they submit a reflection. In this reflection, students justify
    their multimodal composing decisions, describe other, unexplored
    possibilities, and brainstorm ideas for how this project could be up-taken,
    revised, or evolved. However, most importantly, they identify and describe
    the messages found within due to various factors: where the material was
    found, what it means, what it does/can do, etc. As a result, whether in
    assignments or exhibits, students gain a heightened awareness of what
    composition and rhetoric is and can be, and what they as communicators can
    do.
