          <p><strong>Elizabeth F. Chamberlain</strong> is the Director of First-Year Writing and an Assistant Professor of English rhetoric and composition at Arkansas State University; she is also an associate editor with <em>Kairos</em>. Her research addresses media cultural studies, via rhetorical analysis and digital corpus analytics. She has work published or forthcoming in venues including <em>Studies in the Humanities</em>, <em>Computers and Composition Online</em>, the <em>Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</em>, <em>Media Commons</em>, and <em>Wired</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>Kelli R. Gill</strong> is a rhetoric and composition scholar completing her Ph.D. at Texas Christian University, with emphasis in Women and Gender Studies, and New Media.

          <p><strong>Matthew Halm</strong> is a doctoral candidate in the Communication, Rhetoric, and Digital Media program at North Carolina State University. His research incorporates materialist media theory and theories of composition and rhetoric, particularly as they pertain to post-representational understandings of rhetoric, writing, and composing which draw on resources beyond the symbolic. This work incorporates technological and natural processes (which have always been entangled and in many ways indistinguishable) as they produce material effects on the surface of the planet like mountains, rivers, skyscrapers, fiberoptic cables, plants, animals, rhetoric, and writing.</p>

Her work, which is situated at the intersections of race, place, and public memory, has appeared in journals such as <em>Present Tense</em>, <em>The Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory</em>, and <em>Textshop Experiments</em>. ​She tweets at @april_rhetor.</p>
          <p><strong>Laura A. Sparks</strong> is an assistant professor of English at California State University, Chico, where she teaches courses in writing studies and human rights rhetorics. Her current research focuses on the relationship between rhetoric and post-9/11 interrogational torture, with particular attention to digital human rights rhetoric and rhetorical constructions of urgency and timeliness. She has recent and upcoming publications in Present Tense, Journal of Contemporary Poetics, Screen Bodies, and the Digital Rhetoric Collaborative.
