    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
Alongside research and teaching, a growing number of scholars are “making”
work that explores multimodal scholarship. But making is not a new
approach. As a rhetorical concept, making or <em>techne</em> has a long history and
encompasses a wide range of work, from carpentry to circuits. Making, as an
art, craft, or method of study, works with both digital and material
components to trace the connections between technologies, society, and
design. Over the past 20 years, computational and digital tools have become
more affordable and more available, allowing individuals and collaborative
groups to tinker with technology. However, more than merely making for fun,
critical curiosity has created new networks of scholarship, pedagogy, and
power.
</p>
<p>
Playing off of Hayles’ foundational work, “How We Think,” this issue
explores “How We Make” through, with, and alongside technology, creativity,
and design as well as how making impacts society. Our open-access issue
builds upon the work of Katherine Hayles in entangling old and new media,
Matt Ratto in critical making, David Gauntlett in digital DIY, and Carl
DiSalvo in civic tech. Each article emphasizes how humanist scholar/makers
theorize and critically practice making as part of an ecology of
experiences and techniques. In these investigations, connections emerge
between materiality and technology, new modernism and makerism,
collaboration and community, prototyping and play, rhetorical delivery and
digital tools, and teaching and tinkering.
</p>
<p>
The collection begins by examining making as an embodied literary practice.
In "Between Page and Screen, Hands: What it Means to be an Embodied
Reader,” Anne Royston explores the materiality of emerging literacy
practices through print-digital works. Royston first examines Chris
Fritton’s <em>Why We Lose Our Hands</em> to analyze how print-digital works invoke
embodied understandings of reading. Royston compares the fields of digital
literature and contemporary artists’ books to demonstrate how print-digital
works (esp. those that incorporate QR codes or augmented reality) call
attention to the shifting understandings of “old” and “new” media. Royston
asserts that print-digital works are neither “antagonistic" nor “utopian"
about technology, but rather "explore the interplay between print and
screen," stressing the materiality and touch required. Royston then
analyzes Amaranth Borsuk and Brad Bouse’s <em>Between Page and Screen</em> to
demonstrate the destabilizing experience of reading an intermedial hybrid
text, including attempting to hold the book up just right to the camera,
and still having the words fly away. Next, Royston analyzes J.R.
Carpenter’s <em>The Broadside of a Yarn</em> (an installation of maps with QR codes
linked to voiced narratives) to show how multimodal works can incorporate
voice to draw attention to the embodied. Finally, Royston traces Emily Dyer
Barker’s "Public Spectacle Essays" (a series of handmade broadsides with QR
codes installed by collaborators across multiple cities), to show how
print-digital works can be immersive, and "insist on touch" to "communicate
empathy." Looking at layered and interactive media, human and machine,
Royston analyzes the interplay of bodies and technologies to show the
entangled, reflective process by which readers make sense of texts.
</p>
<p>
A humanities approach to making emphasizes critical reflection and can also
challenge product-driven processes. In "New Modernism and Utopian
Creativity,” Jess Wilton traces the intertwining notions of new modernism,
capitalism, and “makerism” to demonstrate how our understandings of
creativity and economy influence perceptions of making. Reexamining the
histories and predecessors of contemporary DIY and maker practices
(including maker spaces), Wilton connects making to the workshops and
networks of modernist/Arts and Crafts movements. Wilton also distinguishes
the democratic, feminist ideals of the DIY ethic, as opposed to the
homogenous structures of the maker movement. She introduces the term
“makerism” and compares it with “modernism” in its utopian gestures, but
contrasts that makerism occurs within institutions. She identifies that the
maker movement and elite makerspaces emphasize technology, fabrication, and
production and are often devoid of mission, philosophy, or self-reflection.
Wilton asserts that these trends demonstrate that English departments have
just as much to add to championing creativity and innovation as STEM and
that humanities can interact with collaborative maker spaces to teach
critical thinking alongside creation.
</p>
<p>
Collaborative maker projects often initiate new types of community
interaction and reflection. In "Contested Spaces: How We Made an Audio
Quilt of One Thousand Names,” xtine burrough and Letícia Ferreira outline
how LabSynthE at the School of Arts, Technology, and Emerging Communication
got started, more as a collaborative group that “produced ideas” rather
than a physical space. They describe the typical workflow of a project,
from a call for proposals, to a team meeting, to the production and
presentation of the work. Ferrera and burrough point out that while one
member may have the initial idea, “the whole lab gets involved” approaching
“the work of the lab as a collective.” They then outline their involvement
in artistically remixing the AIDS Quilt Touch Project, itself a remediation
of the AIDS Memorial Quilt. The lab was invited to participate and
responded to the themes of "community, memory, and ritual." The
installation performance asked participants to record the names of AIDS
victims in DIY audio cards, which were then hung around the building, where
other participants could listen and interact. LabSynthE practices
collaborative DIY maker principles of Garnet Hertz, making projects to
understand how the technology works "through shared, creative practice.”
</p>
<p>
Many approaches to making also encourage a type of play or tinkering to
explore innovative possibilities. In "Prototyping through Play: Making an
Urban Satellite Region Hackathon,” Rachel Hendery, Liam Magee, Andrew
Perry, and Teresa Swist argue that civic hackathons are excellent sites for
playful prototyping. Building off the theory of “civic tech,” the authors
demonstrate how hackathon participants can “playful[ly] engage with
technology” while "motivated by an intent toward social openness and
political possibilities.” Specifically, the authors uncover how the
sketching process before the coding is the location for “socializ[ing] the
digital process of how we make.” The authors started their own hackathon
series in Western Sydney to make their hackathon regionally "accessible to
residents who are potential beneficiaries of the hackathon.” After shifting
from a judging to a show-and-tell model, the authors witnessed a shift from
competition to collaboration where experienced developers project-hopped as
needed and other skilled persons shared assets amongst the teams. The site
for the later hackathons also focused on “social innovation,”
interdisciplinarity, and synergistic making. Borrowing from critical
making, the authors emphasize the importance of an "imperfect prototype as
a public good...in contrast to the desire to make a perfected product” for
capitalistic gain. The authors summarize hackathons as “playful places” and
"interstitial spaces encouraging participants to play with failure,
experimentation, and risk.” Embracing the playful possibilities of making,
the authors highlight the benefits of producing “technological ephemera”
and advocate for the experimental and social value of tinkering with
technologies.
</p>
<p>
Maker projects can even help reframe research questions or rhetorical
concepts. In “’Delivering’ Critical Making: Exploring Rhetorical Delivery’s
Impact on the ‘Maker’ Project,” Steven Smith blends rhetorical scholarship
with physical computing practices and details how to create touch-based,
rhetorically persuasive projects. Drawing on concepts from rhetorical
delivery and critical making, Smith explores digital delivery as a
posthuman practice that allows an audience to insert themselves into a
medium, often by physically interacting with specific materials or media.
Through a process of eversion, individuals can interact with media out in
the surrounding environment and reframe digital delivery as what Sean Morey
calls an “affective attunement with the audience” (216). Walking readers
through the creation of “an everted reality project,” Smith builds on
traditional concepts of rhetorical delivery, but brings in physical
computing to examine digital delivery as a haptic, reciprocal relationship
that allows “users to migrate between the digital and analog.” Detailing
his work with an Arduino microprocessor and conductive paint, Smith shows
how listening, touching, and even the making process can attune an audience
and extend concepts of digital delivery. Through maker-scholarship, Smith
argues that participants have new opportunities to engage digital rhetoric
concepts while also developing what Matt Ratto calls a “body knowledge”
that challenges learners to experience digital media through sensory
interfaces. Combining rhetorical reflection with physical experimentation,
Smith’s work with the multisensory “Musical Vitality” project also
demonstrates how a maker-oriented classroom can explore the “relationship
between rhetorical conventions, online discourse, and embodiment” (60).
</p>
<p>
In addition, pedagogical approaches to making can draw on low-tech
resources to create new opportunities for craft and creativity. In “Equity
by Design: Envisioning a Critical Pedagogy of Making for Educators,” Angela
Elkordy and Ayn Keneman outline their approach to teaching making as
teacher educators. The authors counter the myth that making necessitates
expensive 3D printing and robotics, and emphasize the possibilities of
low-cost, low-tech materials for high-impact learning and creativity. The
authors address the exclusivity in mainstream Maker movement and the
perceptions of value of making as indigenous practice. The article
highlights the shared goals of 21st century learners: “problem solving,
collaboration, cultivation of creativity, design thinking, and
perseverance” and provides specific pedagogical exercises on how to
scaffold these skills. Of particular importance is the emphasis on learning
by making mistakes, gaining confidence in technological expertise over
time, and reflecting on metacognitive processes. The sample course
materials, prompts, student projects, and course reflections all support
the authors’ goals of approaching making equitably in pedagogical design.
</p>
<p>
From embodied compositions to equity in the classroom, <em>How We Make</em>
contributes to ongoing discussions of how making is reshaping communication
and research. As theories, practices, and technologies change, new
approaches continue to emerge across rhetoric, composition, and the
humanities as a whole. We look forward to seeing how making continues to
challenge academic spaces and create new communities of inquiry.
